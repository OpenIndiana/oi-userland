      RAR archives without limitations free of charge, but cannot be
      used to develop RAR (WinRAR) compatible archiver and to
      re-create RAR compression algorithm, which is proprietary.
      Distribution of modified UnRAR source code in separate form
      or as a part of other software is permitted, provided that
      full text of this paragraph, starting from "UnRAR source code"
      words, is included in license, or in documentation if license
      is not available, and in source code comments of resulting package.

   3. The UnRAR utility may be freely distributed. It is allowed
      to distribute UnRAR inside of other software packages.

   4. THE RAR ARCHIVER AND THE UnRAR UTILITY ARE DISTRIBUTED "AS IS".

* We used "Screaming Fast Galois Field Arithmetic Using Intel
  SIMD Instructions" paper by James S. Plank, Kevin M. Greenan
  and Ethan L. Miller to improve Reed-Solomon coding performance.
  Also we are grateful to Artem Drobanov and Bulat Ziganshin
  for samples and ideas allowed to make Reed-Solomon coding
  more efficient.

* RAR text compression algorithm is based on Dmitry Shkarin PPMII
  and Dmitry Subbotin carryless rangecoder public domain source code.
  You may find it in ftp.elf.stuba.sk/pub/pc/pack.

* RAR encryption includes parts of code from Szymon Stefanek
  and Brian Gladman AES implementations also as Steve Reid SHA-1 source.
