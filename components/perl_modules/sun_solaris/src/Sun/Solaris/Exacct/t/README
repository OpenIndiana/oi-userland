This directory contains a stress-test harness for the ::Exacct module.
This will detect bugs in both the perl code and the underlying libexacct
library.  To use, build the ::Exacct module in the parent directory, then:

$ cc -o randtest randtest.c -lexacct
$ chmod a+x RandTest
$ ./RandTest

The test script will run until interrupted by SIGINT.  If any errors are
detected, the script will exit and leave diganostic files in /tmp.

Running this under a memory checker, e.g. the WorkShop debugger or libumem
is also a good way of detecting errors.

If you wish to run this on the installed version of the ::Exacct module,
remove the 'use blib' statement on line 14 of RandTest.
