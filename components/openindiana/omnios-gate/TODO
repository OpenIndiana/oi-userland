Anticipated TODO:

* after getting the build done, tweak pkg manifests to
  have the two illumos-gate options as pkg variants

* sort out ipkg/lipkg/nlipkg (ensure OI stance on the
  naming works in the other OS/Net variant too; maybe
  support the missing brand name in both)

* @ptribble suggested there may be hardcoded perl versions
  and similar nuances in illumos-omnios gate to tweak for
  the "non-native" build host environments
