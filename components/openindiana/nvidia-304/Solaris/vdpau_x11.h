/**

 *
 * The set of VDPAU functionality specific to usage with the X
 * Window System.
 *
 * \section Driver Library Layout
 *
 * An X11-oriented VDPAU installation consists of the following
 * components:
 *
 * - Header files. These files are located in the standard
 *   system header file path.
 *   - \c vdpau/vdpau.h
 *   - \c vdpau/vdpau_x11.h
 * - The VDPAU wrapper library. These files are located in the
 *   standard system (possibly X11-specific) library path.
 *   - \c libvdpau.so.1 (runtime)
 *   - \c libvdpau.so (development)
 * - Back-end driver files. These files are located in a
 *   system-defined library path, which is configurable at compile
 *   time but is typically /usr/lib/vdpau.  Use `pkg-config
 *   --variable=moduledir vdpau` to locate the driver install path.
 *   - \c $moduledir/libvdpau_\%s.so.1
 *   For example:
 *   - \c /usr/lib/vdpau/libvdpau_nvidia.so.1
 *   - \c /usr/lib/vdpau/libvdpau_intel.so.1
 *   - \c /usr/lib/vdpau/libvdpau_ati.so.1
 *
 * The VDPAU wrapper library implements just one function; \ref
 * vdp_device_create_x11. The wrapper will implement this function
 * by dynamically loading the appropriate back-end driver file
 * mentioned above. Long-term, the wrapper will use a
 * VDPAU-specific X  extension to determine which back-end driver
 * to load. Currently, the wrapper library hard-codes the driver
 * name as "nvidia", although this can be overridden using the
 * environment variable VDPAU_DRIVER.
 *
 * The back-end driver is expected to implement a function named
 * \b vdp_imp_device_create_x11. The wrapper will call this function to
 * actually implement the \ref vdp_device_create_x11 application call.
 *
 * Note that it is theoretically possible for an application to
 * create multiple \ref VdpDevice "VdpDevice" objects. In this
 * case, the wrapper library may load multiple back-end drivers
 * into the same application, and/or invoke a specific back-end
 * driver's \b VdpImpDeviceCreateX11 multiple times. The wrapper
 * libray imposes no policy regarding whether the application
 * may instantiate multiple \ref VdpDevice "VdpDevice" objects for
 * the same display and/or screen. However, back-end drivers are
 * free to limit the number of \ref VdpDevice "VdpDevice" objects
 * as required by their implementation.

 * Note: VDPAU expects to own the entire drawable for the duration of time

 * as required. As such, it is recommended that applications create a
 * dedicated window for the presentation queue target, as a child
 * (grand-child, ...) of their top-level application window.
 *
 * Applications may also create child-windows of the presentation queue
 * target, which will cover any presented video in the normal fashion. VDPAU
 * implementations will not manipulate such child windows in any fashion.
