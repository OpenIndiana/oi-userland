rst2man does a poor job of creating man pages that can be read on Solaris.
Some of the changes in this patch make the Solaris *roff tools do the right
thing:

  - Getting rid of the rst2man header before the SYNOPSIS

  - Changing "\(aq" to "'", and making sure that single quotes don't start
    a line (at least in a couple of places where it's not safe)

  - Changing ".ft C" and ".ft P" to simply ".ft"

  - Removing "\%" and "\:"

Groff also makes hash of an .IP terminated by .RE (the .RE sends the
following paragraphs all the way to the left margin, rather than simply
terminating the indented paragraph).  It needs a preceding .RS to do the
right thing, and .RS 0 seems to give the best effect.  Probably most
.INDENT/.UNINDENT pairs should be converted to .RS/.RE, too.
