The library is compiled with 4.7.3 version of the GCC C++ compiler. Therefore to use the C++ API and data from the library, users of the library must also use the same version or compatible version of GCC 4.7 or later compilers to compile their program sources. There is no such restrictions on C API in terms of compatible compilers in general.
