*help_minimized.txt*	For Vim version 7.3a.  Last change: 2011 May 4

This minimization notice is being displayed because the vim installed on
this system is the minimized version (editor/vim/vim-core).  This minimized
version does not include online help.  Also absent are syntax highlighting,
language-specific indentation, spell-checking dictionaries, plugins,
keyboard mappings, etc.  If you wish to have a richer vim environment,
please ensure that the package containing the complete vim runtime
(editor/vim) is installed using pkg(1).  The command 'pkg install editor/vim'
should install the runtime package.
