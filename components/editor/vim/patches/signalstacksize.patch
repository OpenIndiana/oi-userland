This patch works around an issue with vim dumping core with SIGSEGV when
handling a more benign signal (typically SIGHUP or SIGTERM).  Vim tries to
run all the exit-vim autocommands, which end up busting the alternate stack
at its default size.  Doubling the default seems to do the trick, but it
continues to be just a guess.

This fix was suggested by the maintainer, but the patch has not yet been
submitted upstream.
