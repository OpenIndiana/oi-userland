NAME:             emacs
VERSION:          24.5
DESCRIPTION:      GNU Emacs editor
LICENSE:          GPLv3
BUGTRAQ:          solaris/utility/emacs
COMMENTS:         

This file contains information about the emacs package within the Userland
consolidation. Along with the comments in the Makefile, it documents any
deviations from standard Userland or emacs practice, as well as miscellaneous
information needed to understand how this component is put together.


- We patch the following changes to the emacs sources:

	find.patch
	    The rgrep function uses the GNU-specific -path option to the
	    find command. Change the default value for the find-program
	    variable in grep.el to use GNU find.

- The emacs distribution used to have a subdirectory, src/s, which
  contained per-platform header files. We would apply the following
  patches:

    sol2-6.h: Enable the use of the native Solaris dldump()

  These are both handled by default by the configure process, and in fact,
  comments from the header file appear to have been carried over. With every
  update, we must verify that these settings stick and remain enabled.

    System Malloc:
    The information output at the end of the configure step verifies this:

        Configured for `x86_64-pc-solaris2.12'.
	...
          Should Emacs use the GNU version of malloc?             no
            (The GNU allocators don't work with this system configuration.)

    dldump:
    One could examine the configure script looking for the setting
    "UNEXEC_OBJ=unexsol.o", but it seems easier/better to simply examine
    the final executable:

        % pvs -nos emacs | grep dldump
        emacs - libc.so.1 (SUNW_1.22): dldump;

- Emacs can be built as either 32-bit or 64-bit, depending on the target
  machine. The benefit of a 64-bit emacs is that the size of the files it
  can handle is not limited to 128MB, as it is with the 32-bit version.

  For Solaris, we used to build both versions, using /usr/lib/isaexec to
  run the 64-bit version if possible, and the 32-bit version otherwise. Note
  that this was only done for the emacs binary itself, as there is no
  technical need for 64-bit versions of the ancillary programs that come
  with emacs (etags, emacsclient, etc).

  Fortunately, the vast majority of the files in an emacs tree are identical,
  regardless of the platform and/or word size, which makes this particularly
  easy to do.

  With Solaris 11, all kernels are 64-bit, and we therefore do not need
  the 32-bit executables. As such, we only supply 64-bit emacs binaries now,
  and the use of usr/lib/isaexec has been removed: This cuts the number of
  builds necessary in half, and also the binary package size. It also
  simplifies packaging, and the user's view of /usr/bin/emacs*.

- There are three different toolkit options: None, Athena widgets
  (aka Xaw, or lucid), and gtk. It would be nice to only support gtk,
  but for purposes of minimization and user preference, we supply binaries
  for all three. We follow the Linux model in this regard. The Xaw and no-X
  versions are quite stable from release to release, so this isn't a large
  burden.

- In the past, we built emacs with gcc. The Makefile contained:

    # This code is built with gcc. The primary reason for this is that the
    # configure script has problems using a non-GNU cpp. I am not aware of
    # any reason Sun Studio could not be made to work, but simply made a
    # cost/benefit decision not to pursue it at this time
    COMPILER =      gcc

  With emacs 24.3, I removed this, and find that studio now builds
  emacs without issue. This is something that should be reverified
  with each update.

- Remember to update REQUIRED_PACKAGES when updating to a new version,
  as dependencies can change. Instructions are on the Userland website.

- We deliver the following packages:

	gnu-emacs - Everything you need to run emacs, except the
	    emacs binaries.

	gnu-emacs-gtk - Binary for the X11 version using the GTK toolkit.

	gnu-emacs-no-x11 - Pure tty emacs binary, built without
	    any X11 linkage or other extra support (i.e. D-bus). This
	    is the most basic emacs possible, ideal for headless server
	    systems.

	gnu-emacs-x11 - Binary for the X11 version using the Athena
	    widget (Xaw) toolkit.

	gnu-emacs-lisp - The compressed LISP files for which compiled
	    versions are delivered by gnu-emacs. These are only needed
	    for emacs developers and those who like to read source code.

  The core gnu-emacs package is required by all of the other packages.
  In turn, gnu-emacs requires at least one of the packages supplying an
  emacs binary to be installed.

- We do not ship any suid/sgid binaries for obvious security reasons.

  We do not install the files under /var/games/emacs. The reason for
  this is that we do not install update-game-score as setuid, and
  therefore the game files are not usable. This the same decision made
  by Debian, among others.
