/**
 * \addtogroup PedTimer
 *
 * \brief A PedTimer keeps track of the progress of a single (possibly 
 * compound) operation.  
 *
 * The user of libparted constructs a PedTimer, and passes it to libparted 
 * functions that are likely to be expensive operations 
 * (like ped_file_system_resize).  Use of timers is optional... you may
 * pass NULL instead.
 * 
 * When you create a PedTimer, you must specify a timer handler function.
 * This will be called when there's an update on how work is progressing.
 * 
 * Timers may be nested.  When a timer is constructed, you can choose
 * to assign it a parent, along with an estimate of what proportion of
 * the total (parent's) time will be used in the nested operation.  In
 * this case, the nested timer's handler is internal to libparted,
 * and simply updates the parent's progress, and calls its handler.
 *
