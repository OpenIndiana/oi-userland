# NUT data server binaries, shared baseline for drivers, and other resources.
# The upsd should be on the same system as drivers (talking over Unix sockets
# to them) but may be a different system from monitoring clients which just
# want to shut down in time.

### Data server and its resources

# For troubleshooting or last-resort automation: tap into Unix sockets
# between upsd and drivers. See nut/docs/sock-protocol.txt for details.

# Services for data server and drivers.
# NUT should start generally after networking (if SNMP or NetXML is used,
# or if this box is a client to remote upsd). Ending is trickier - could
# want it to issue killpower late in shutdown, but have network to be able
# to do so (for remote UPSes). This can be tuned in XML manifest by user.

### Shared by data server and drivers

# Technically this is file is relevant to a nut-server (upsd) and to
# drivers, but they should be on same system anyway and NDE above uses
# it directly. Also upsd may be told to start without any driver config
# (to report "I am alive and known nothing") but drivers can not.
# So it is here. We deliver the sample configs as the ones to use,
# at worst they have no actual information inside and do nothing.
