# NUT umbrella service
# Services for monitoring client (upsmon) generally does not have to be
# present and running on the same system as a data server and drivers.
# NUT should start generally after networking (if SNMP or NetXML is used,
# or if this box is a client to remote upsd). Ending is trickier - could
# want it to issue killpower late in shutdown, but have network to be able
# to do so (for remote UPSes). This can be tuned in XML manifest by user.
