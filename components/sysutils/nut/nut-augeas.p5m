# This binding needs Augeas to be functional, but we don't want to require
# installation of augtools if the end-user just installs the grouper package
# and really only wants NUT core, not the bindings. Vice-versa, the binding
# does not really require files from the NUT project itself.
# So: the main "nut.p5m" has a conditional dependency to install "nut-augeas"
# only if "augeas-tools" are installed; while the "nut-augeas" package simply
# requires augtools and does not depend on any of NUT packages to be present.
