delayedInstanceOid OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      Integer32
    MAX-ACCESS  read-write
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
	"This is a simple object which is a basic integer.  It's value
	 indicates the number of seconds that the agent will take in
	 responding to requests of this object.  This is implemented
	 in a way which will allow the agent to keep responding to
	 other requests while access to this object is blocked.  It is
	 writable, and changing it's value will change the amount of
	 time the agent will effectively wait for before returning a
	 response when this object is manipulated.  Note that SET
	 requests through this object will take longer, since the
	 delay is applied to each internal transaction phase, which
	 could result in delays of up to 4 times the value of this
	 object.

	 This example object is implemented in the
	 demo_module_9 example module."
