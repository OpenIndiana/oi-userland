COMPONENT_NAME=         git-crypt
COMPONENT_VERSION=      0.7.0
COMPONENT_SUMMARY=      git-crypt - transparent file encryption in git
COMPONENT_DESCRIPTION=	\
	git-crypt enables transparent encryption and decryption of files in a git repository. \
	Files which you choose to protect are encrypted when committed, and decrypted when checked out. \
	git-crypt lets you freely share a repository containing a mix of public and private content. \
	git-crypt gracefully degrades, so developers without the secret key can still clone and commit to \
	a repository with encrypted files. This lets you store your secret material (such as keys or passwords) \
	in the same repository as your code, without requiring you to lock down your entire repository.
