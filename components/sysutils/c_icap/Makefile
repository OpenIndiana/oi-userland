COMPONENT_VERSION=	0.5.11
COMPONENT_SUMMARY=	The c-icap project
COMPONENT_DESCRIPTION=	c-icap is an implementation of an ICAP server. It can be \
			used with HTTP proxies that support the ICAP protocol to \
			implement content adaptation and filtering services. \
			Most of the commercial HTTP proxies must support the ICAP \
			protocol. The open source Squid 3.x proxy server supports it.
