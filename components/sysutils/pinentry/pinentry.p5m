# pinentry needs the proc_lock_memory privilege in order to be able to lock a
# memory segment. If it can't do that, it utters
#    pinentry: Warning: using insecure memory!
# Using the illumos forced privileges feature, we afford it the additional
# privilege by making it setuid (really needed here) root and installing an
# exec_attr entry to add just the necessary privilege. See files/exec_attr.
