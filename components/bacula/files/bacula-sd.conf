# Default Bacula Storage Daemon Configuration file

#  For Bacula release 5.2.13 (19 February 2013) -- solaris 5.11
#
# You may need to change the name of your tape drive
#   on the "Archive Device" directive in the Device
#   resource.  If you change the Name and/or the 
#   "Media Type" in the Device resource, please ensure
#   that dird.conf has corresponding changes.
