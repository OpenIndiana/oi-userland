A few exceptions are:
- We have a copy of the GLU tesselator in cogl-path/tesselator which
  is licensed under the SGI Free Software License B, version 2.0

  This license is essentially identical to the MIT license with
  the option to refer to a web address for a copy of the notice
  in documentation.
- cogl-point-in-poly.c is under a 3 clause BSD license
- stb_image.c is public domain.

Please see individual files for details.

deps/glib is licensed under the LGPL (please see individual files for
details and deps/glib/COPYING for a copy of the LGPL license) This
code is only referenced when building Cogl with the --standalone
configure option.
