.SH NAME
guile-tools \- displays guile module information 
.SH SYNOPSIS
/usr/bin/guile-tools [OPTION] PROGRAM [ARGS ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
'guile-tools' is a wrapper program and installed along w/ `guile'; it 
knows where a particular module is installed and calls it passing its
args to the program. The result is that you need not augment your PATH.  
.LP
Usage is straightforward:
 
      guile-tools --help
      guile-tools --version
      guile-tools [OPTION] PROGRAM [ARGS ...]
.LP 
When Guile is installed, in addition to the `(ice-9 FOO)' modules, a
set of "executable modules" `(scripts BAR)' is also installed.  Each 
is a regular Scheme module that has some additional packaging so 
that it can be called as a program in its own right, from the shell.
For this reason, we sometimes use the term "script" in this context 
to mean the same thing.
.LP
If PROGRAM is "list" or omitted, display contents of scripts dir, 
otherwise PROGRAM is run with ARGS. Options (only one of which may be
used at a time):
.LP
 --scriptsdir DIR - Look in DIR for scripts
 --guileversion VERS - Look in $pkgdatadir/VERS/scripts for scripts
 --source - Display PROGRAM source (ignore ARGS) to stdout
.LP
The modules are self-documenting.  For example, to see the 
documentation for `lint', use one (or both) of the shell commands:
 
        guile-tools display-commentary '(scripts lint)'
        guile-tools --source lint
