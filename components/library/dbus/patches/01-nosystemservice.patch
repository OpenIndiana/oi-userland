   <!-- We use system service launching using a helper -->
+  <!-- Disabling D-Bus system services.
+       To support this feature as it is on, it would be necessary to create a
+       messagebus user and configure the D-Bus module to specify the
+       with-dbus-user=messagebus option.  This causes the D-Bus system daemon
+       to run as this user and use dbus-daemon-launch-helper when privilege is
+       required.  Solaris does not include anything that uses system services,
+       so this would only be needed if you wish to wished to use an application
+       that required it.
