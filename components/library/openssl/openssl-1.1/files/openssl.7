.SH NAME
openssl \- OpenSSL cryptographic and Secure Sockets Layer toolkit
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
OpenSSL is a cryptography toolkit that implements the Transport Layer Security (TLS v1+) network protocols.  This version of OpenSSL no longer supports the Secure Sockets Layer (SSLv2/v3) network protocols.
.sp
.LP
The following features are omitted from the binaries for issues including but not limited to patents, trademark, and US export restrictions: DES, RC2, RC4, RC5, MD2, MD4, MDC2, IDEA, Whirlpool, SEED. Also, there are no OpenSSL engines.
.SS "The Dynamic Engine Support"
.sp
.LP
The dynamic engine support has been enabled, which allows an external engine, in the form of a shared library, to be dynamically bound and used by an OpenSSL-based application.
.sp
.LP
Run the following command to see if the dynamic engine is supported:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ \fBopenssl engine dynamic\fR
(dynamic) Dynamic engine loading support
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SS "FIPS Mode"
.sp
.LP
There is no FIPS-140 mode for OpenSSL 1.1.
.sp

.SS "The PKCS#11 Engine"
.sp
.LP
The PKCS#11 engine is not delivered with OpenSSL 1.1.
.sp

.SS "Building an OpenSSL Application"
.sp
.LP
Assuming OpenSSL 1.1 was activated using the \fBpkg set-mediator\fR command,
to build an OpenSSL application, use the following \fBcc\fR command line options:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
cc [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lcrypto -lssl [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
.fi
.in -2

.SS "Additional Documentation"
.sp
.LP
Extensive additional documentation for OpenSSL modules is available in the \fB/usr/share/man/man1openssl\fR, \fB/usr/share/man/man3openssl\fR, \fB/usr/share/man/man5openssl\fR, and \fB/usr/share/man/man7openssl\fR directories.
