Replace getpass() with getpassphrase(), to avoid sctrict password length
limitation. The former one, as provided in Solaris libc, only accepts 8
characters, while latter one accepts 256 characters. See getpass(3C) manual
page.

On Linux, the problem doesn't exist, the glibc version of getpass() is
unlimited. To match it on Solaris, we would have to provide own function, but
then the secret-tool internally doesn't care too much about long passwords too,
e.g. the function that reads password from standard input (read_password_stdin)
limits the input by reading into single 8k buffer.
