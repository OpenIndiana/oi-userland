# If SHELLOPTS is exported (as it is by the userland makefiles),
# then all shell options get exported to child invocations of bash,
# which results in test failures due to nounset and xtrace being
# set unexpectedly, and errors such as "$1: unbound variable" and
# diffs failing due to script tracing in output files.
