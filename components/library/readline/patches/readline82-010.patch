			   READLINE PATCH REPORT
			   =====================

Readline-Release: 8.2
Patch-ID: readline82-010

Bug-Reported-by:	Martin Castillo <castilma@uni-bremen.de>
Bug-Reference-ID:	<2d42153b-cf65-caba-dff1-cd3bc6268c7e@uni-bremen.de>
Bug-Reference-URL:	https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-readline/2023-01/msg00000.html

Bug-Description:

Fix the case where text to be completed from the line buffer (quoted) is
compared to the common prefix of the possible matches (unquoted) and the
quoting makes the former appear to be longer than the latter. Readline
assumes the match doesn't add any characters to the word and doesn't display
multiple matches.

Patch (apply with `patch -p0'):
