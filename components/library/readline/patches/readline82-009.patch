			   READLINE PATCH REPORT
			   =====================

Readline-Release: 8.2
Patch-ID: readline82-009

Bug-Reported-by:	Stefan H. Holek <stefan@epy.co.at>
Bug-Reference-ID:	<50F8DA45-B7F3-4DE1-AB94-19AE42649CDC@epy.co.at>
Bug-Reference-URL:	https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-readline/2022-10/msg00021.html

Bug-Description:

Fix issue where the directory name portion of the word to be completed (the
part that is passed to opendir()) requires both tilde expansion and dequoting.
Readline only performed tilde expansion in this case, so filename completion
would fail.

Patch (apply with `patch -p0'):
