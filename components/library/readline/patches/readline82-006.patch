			   READLINE PATCH REPORT
			   =====================

Readline-Release: 8.2
Patch-ID: readline82-006

Bug-Description:

This is a variant of the same issue as the one fixed by patch 5. In this
case, the signal arrives and is pending before readline calls rl_getc().
When this happens, the pending signal will be handled by the loop, but may
alter or destroy some state that the callback uses. Readline needs to treat
this case the same way it would if a signal interrupts pselect/select, so
compound operations like searches and reading numeric arguments get cleaned
up properly.

Patch (apply with `patch -p0'):
