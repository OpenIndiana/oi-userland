We have problems updating icu because IPS (pkg) depends on it.
As soon as new libraries with other sonames will be installed everything depending on them is dysfunctional,
eg. pkg and sshd. Thus, special treatment is needed in order to be able to update icu.
Before the upgrade happens we need to backup all libraries and after the upgrade we need to put the old libraries in place until
everything has been updated. Note that it is mandatory to be logged in when doing the icu upgrade otherwise you'll be locked out.
