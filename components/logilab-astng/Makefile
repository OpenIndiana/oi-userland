# The tests are run using python 2.7 only and require that
# the python-27 package is installed (does not have to be the default python). 
# Testing using python-26 is done manually, since it requires
# downloading and installing the unittest2 component (not part of Solaris).
# which provides python 2.7 functionality to the unittest python library
# in the python2.6 package.

# Use the python 2.7 libraries for testing.

# before running logilab-astng tests.
