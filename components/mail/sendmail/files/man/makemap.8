\fBmakemap\fR [\fB-N\fR] [\fB-d\fR] [\fB-f\fR] [\fB-o\fR] [\fB-r\fR] [\fB-s\fR] [\fB-v\fR] [\fB-C\fR \fIfile\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBmakemap\fR creates the database maps used by the keyed map lookups in \fBsendmail\fR(8). \fBmakemap\fR reads from the standard input and outputs to the specified \fImapname\fR. 
.sp
.LP
In all cases, \fBmakemap\fR reads lines from the standard input consisting of two words separated by whitespace. The first is the database key, the second is the value. The value may contain \fB%\fR\fIn\fR strings to indicated parameter substitution. Literal percents should be doubled (\fB%%\fR). Blank lines and lines beginning with \fB#\fR are ignored.
.sp
.LP
\fBmakemap\fR handles three different database formats. Database format is selected using the \fImaptype\fR parameter. See \fBOPERANDS\fR. 
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR \fIcachesize\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Use the specified hash and B-Tree cache size (\fIcachesize\fR).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-C\fR \fIfile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Use the specified sendmail configuration file (\fIfile\fR) for looking up the TrustedUser option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-d\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Allow duplicate keys in the map. This is only allowed on B-Tree format maps. If two identical keys are read, both be inserted into the map.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-D\fR \fIcommentchar\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Use the specified character to indicate a comment (which is ignored) instead of the default of '\fB#\fR'.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Allow empty value (right hand side).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Normally, all upper case letters in the key are folded to lower case. This flag disables that behavior. This is intended to mesh with the \fB-f\fR flag in the \fBK\fR line in \fBsendmail.cf\fR. The value is never case folded.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-l\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
List supported map types.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-N\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Include the null byte that terminates strings in the map. This must match the \fB-N\fR flag in the \fBK\fR line in \fBsendmail.cf\fR 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-o\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Append to an old file. This allows you to augment an existing file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Allow replacement of existing keys. Normally \fBmakemap\fR complains if you repeat a key, and does not do the insert.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Ignore safety checks on maps being created. This includes checking for hard or symbolic links in world writable directories.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR \fIdelim\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Use the specified delimiter (\fIdelim\fR) instead of whitespace.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-u\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Dump (unmap) the content of the database to standard output. Note that, if the \fB-t\fR option is also provided, the specified delimiter is used when the content is dumped instead of whitespace.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
.rt  
Verbosely print what it is doing.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
