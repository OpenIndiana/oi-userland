.TH smrsh 8 "8 Mar 2016" "SunOS 5.12" "System Administration Commands"
.SH NAME
smrsh \- restricted shell for sendmail
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBsmrsh\fR \fB-c\fR \fIcommand\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsmrsh\fR program is intended as a replacement for the \fBsh\fR command in the \fBprog\fR mailer in \fBsendmail\fR(8) configuration files. The \fBsmrsh\fR program sharply limits commands that can be run using the \fB|program\fR syntax of \fBsendmail\fR. This improves overall system security. \fBsmrsh\fR limits the set of programs that a programmer can execute, even if \fBsendmail\fR runs a program without going through an \fBalias\fR or \fBforward\fR file.
.sp
.LP
Briefly, \fBsmrsh\fR limits programs to be in the directory \fB/var/adm/sm.bin\fR, allowing system administrators to choose the set of acceptable commands. It also rejects any commands with the characters: \fB,\fR, \fB<\fR, \fB>\fR, \fB|\fR, \fB;\fR, \fB&\fR, \fB$\fR, \fB\er\fR (RETURN), or \fB\en\fR (NEWLINE) on the command line to prevent end run attacks.
.sp
.LP
Initial pathnames on programs are stripped, so forwarding to \fB/usr/bin/vacation\fR, \fB/home/server/mydir/bin/vacation\fR, and vacation all actually forward to \fB/var/adm/sm.bin/vacation\fR.
.sp
.LP
System administrators should be conservative about populating \fB/var/adm/sm.bin\fR. Reasonable additions are utilities such as \fBvacation\fR(1) and \fBprocmail\fR. Never include any shell or shell-like program (for example, \fBperl\fR) in the \fBsm.bin\fR directory. This does not restrict the use of \fBshell\fR or \fBperl\fR scrips in the \fBsm.bin\fR directory (using the \fB#!\fR syntax); it simply disallows the execution of arbitrary programs.
.SH OPTIONS
