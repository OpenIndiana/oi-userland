.TH editmap 8 "8 Mar 2016" "SunOS 5.12" "System Administration Commands"
.SH NAME
editmap \- query and edit single records in database maps for sendmail
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBeditmap\fR \fB-C\fR \fIfile\fR [\fB-N\fR] [\fB-f\fR] [\fB-q\fR | \fB-u\fR | \fB-x\fR] \fImaptype\fR \fImapname\fR \fIkey\fR

.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBeditmap\fR command queries or edits one record in a database maps used by the keyed map lookups in \fBsendmail\fR(8). Arguments are passed on the command line and output (for queries) is directed to standard output. 
.sp
.LP
Depending on how it is compiled, \fBeditmap\fR handles up to three different database formats, selected using the \fImaptype\fR parameter. See \fBOPERANDS\fR.
.sp
.LP
 If the \fBTrustedUser\fR option is set in the \fBsendmail\fR configuration file and \fBeditmap\fR is invoked as root, the generated files are owned by the specified \fBTrustedUser\fR. 
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-C\fR \fIfile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Use the specified \fBsendmail\fR configuration file (\fIfile\fR) to look up the \fBTrustedUser\fR option.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Disable the folding of all upper case letters in the key to lower case. Normally, all upper case letters in the key are folded to upper case. This is intended to mesh with the \fB-f\fR flag in the \fBK\fR line  in \fBsendmail.cf\fR. The value is never case folded.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-N\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
 Include the null byte that terminates strings in the map (for alias maps).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-q\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Query the map for the specified key. If found, print value to standard output and exit with \fB0\fR. If not found then print an error message to \fBstdout\fR and exit with \fBEX_UNAVAILABLE\fR. 
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-u\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
Update the record for key with value or inserts a new record if one doesn't exist. Exits with \fB0\fR on success or \fBEX_IOERR\fR on failure.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-x\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
.rt  
 Delete the specific key from the map. Exit with \fB0\fR on success or \fBEX_IOERR\fR on failure.
