.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBsendmail\fR utility sends a message to one or more people, routing the message over whatever networks are necessary. \fBsendmail\fR does internetwork forwarding as necessary to deliver the message to the correct place.
.sp
.LP
\fBsendmail\fR is not intended as a user interface routine. Other programs provide user-friendly front ends. \fBsendmail\fR is used only to deliver pre-formatted messages.
.sp
.LP
With no flags, \fBsendmail\fR reads its standard input up to an EOF, or a line with a single dot, and sends a copy of the letter found there to all of the addresses listed. It determines the network to use based on the syntax and contents of the addresses.
.sp
.LP
Local addresses are looked up in the local \fBaliases\fR(5) file, or in a name service as defined by the \fBnsswitch.conf\fR(5) file, and aliased appropriately. In addition, if there is a \fB.forward\fR file in a recipient's home directory, \fBsendmail\fR forwards a copy of each message to the list of recipients that file contains. Refer to the \fBNOTES\fR section for more information about \fB.forward\fR files. Aliasing can be prevented by preceding the address with a backslash. 
.sp
.LP
There are several conditions under which the expected behavior is for the alias database to be either built or rebuilt. This cannot occur under any circumstances unless root owns \fBand\fR has exclusive write permission to the \fB/etc/mail/aliases*\fR files.
.sp
.LP
If a message is found to be undeliverable, it is returned to the sender with diagnostics that indicate the location and nature of the failure; or, the message is placed in a \fBdead.letter\fR file in the sender's home directory.
.SS "Service Management"
.sp
.LP
The \fBsendmail\fR service is managed by the service management facility, \fBsmf\fR(7), under the service identifiers:
.sp
.in +2
.nf


svc:/network/smtp:sendmail
svc:/network/sendmail-client:default
 
.fi
.in -2
.sp
.sp
.LP
Administrative actions on these services, such as enabling, disabling, or requesting restart, can be performed using \fBsvcadm\fR(8). The services' status can be queried using the \fBsvcs\fR(1) command.
.sp
.LP
These are separate services rather than instances of the same service so that other services can properly express any dependencies. In particular, here are some guidelines about which service/instance should be depended on for which purposes:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
For a service that uses \fBsendmail\fR to send mail, an optional dependency on the service \fBsvc:/network/sendmail-client\fR might be in order. 

.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
For a service that needs to receive mail in general, but does not depend on \fBsendmail\fR being the particular SMTP receiver, a dependency on the service \fBsvc:/network/smtp\fR might be in order. 

.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
For a service that needs to interact with sendmail in particular, such as a \fBMilter\fR, a dependency on the instance \fBsvc:/network/smtp:sendmail\fR might be in order. 

.RE
.sp
.LP
For the last two, note the difference, as the latter has the \fB":sendmail"\fR instance specification, whereas the former does not, thus representing the more general service.
.SS "Enabling Access to Remote Clients"
.sp
.LP
On an unmodified system, access to \fBsendmail\fR by remote clients is enabled and disabled through the service management facility (see \fBsmf\fR(7)). In particular, remote access is determined by the value of the \fBlocal_only\fR SMF property:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/network/smtp:sendmail/config/local_only = true
.fi
.in -2
.sp
.sp
.LP
A setting of \fBtrue\fR, as above, disallows remote access; \fBfalse\fR allows remote access. The default value is \fBtrue\fR.
.sp
.LP
The following example shows the sequence of SMF commands used to enable \fBsendmail\fR to allow access to remote systems:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBsvccfg -s svc:/network/smtp:sendmail setprop config/local_only = false\fR
# \fBsvcadm refresh svc:/network/smtp:sendmail\fR
# \fBsvcadm restart svc:/network/smtp:sendmail\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp
.sp
.LP
See \fBsvcadm\fR(8) and \fBsvccfg\fR(8).
.sp
.LP
Note, however, on a system where any of the \fBsendmail\fR(5) files have been customized, setting this property might not have the intended effect. See \fBsendmail\fR(5) for details.
.SS "Automated Rebuilding of Configuration Files"
.sp
.LP
See \fBsendmail\fR(5) for details on which service properties can be set to automate (re)building of configuration files when the service is started.
.SS "Restricting Host Access"
.sp
.LP
\fBsendmail\fR uses TCP Wrappers to restrict access to hosts. It uses the service name of \fBsendmail\fR for \fBhosts_access()\fR. For more information on TCP Wrappers, see \fBtcpd\fR(8) and \fBhosts_access\fR(5) in the \fBsecurity/tcp-wrapper\fR package. \fBtcpd\fR(8) and \fBhosts_access\fR(5) are not part of the Solaris man pages.
.SS "Startup Options"
.sp
.LP
The \fB/etc/default/sendmail\fR file stores startup options for \fBsendmail\fR so that the options are not removed when a host is upgraded. See also \fBsendmail\fR(5) for details on which service properties can be set to automate (re)building of configuration files when the service is started.
.sp
.LP
You can use the following variables in the \fB/etc/default/sendmail\fR startup file:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBCLIENTOPTIONS=\fIstring\fR\fR
.ad
.br
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Selects additional options to be used with the client daemon, which looks in the client-only queue (\fB/var/spool/clientmqueue\fR) and acts as a client queue runner. No syntax checking is done, so be careful when making changes to this variable.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBCLIENTQUEUEINTERVAL=\fI#\fR\fR
.ad
.br
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Similar to the \fBQUEUEINTERVAL\fR option, \fBCLIENTQUEUEINTERVAL\fR sets the time interval for mail queue runs. However, the \fBCLIENTQUEUEINTERVAL\fR option controls the functions of the client daemon, instead of the functions of the master daemon. Typically, the master daemon is able to deliver all messages to the SMTP port. However, if the message load is too high or the master daemon is not running, then messages go into the client-only queue, \fB/var/spool/clientmqueue\fR. The client daemon, which checks in the client-only queue, then acts as a client queue processor.
.RE

.ne 2
.mk

\fBETRN_HOSTS=\fIstring\fR\fR
.ad

.sp .6
.RS 4n

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBQUEUEINTERVAL=\fI#\fR\fR
.ad
.br
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Sets the interval for mail queue runs on the master daemon. \fI#\fR can be a positive integer that is followed by either \fBs\fR for seconds, \fBm\fR for minutes, \fBh\fR for hours, \fBd\fR for days, or \fBw\fR for weeks. The syntax is checked before \fBsendmail\fR is started. If the interval is negative or if the entry does not end with an appropriate letter, the interval is ignored and \fBsendmail\fR starts with a queue interval of 15 minutes.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBQUEUEOPTIONS=p\fR
.ad
.br
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enables one persistent queue runner that sleeps between queue run intervals, instead of a new queue runner for each queue run interval. You can set this option to \fBp\fR, which is the only setting available. Otherwise, this option is not set.

.SS "Processing Options"
.sp
.LP
There are a number of "random" options that can be set from a configuration file. Options are represented by a single character or by multiple character names. The syntax for the single character names of is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBO\fR\fIxvalue\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp
.sp
.LP
This sets option \fIx\fR to be \fIvalue\fR. Depending on the option, \fIvalue\fR may be a string, an integer, a boolean (with legal values \fBt\fR, \fBT\fR, \fBf\fR, or \fBF\fR; the default is \fBTRUE\fR), or a time interval.
.sp
.LP
The multiple character or long names use this syntax:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBO\fR \fILongname=argument\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp
.sp
.LP
This sets the option \fILongname\fR to be \fIargument\fR. The long names are beneficial because they are easier to interpret than the single character names.

.sp .6

If set to a value greater than zero (the default is one), it suppresses the MX lookups on addresses when they are initially sorted, that is, for the first delivery attempt. This usually results in faster envelope splitting unless the MX records are readily available in a local DNS cache. To enforce initial sorting based on MX records set \fBFastSplit\fR to zero. If the mail is submitted directly from the command line, then the value also limits the number of processes to deliver the envelopes; if more envelopes are created they are only queued up and must be taken care of by a queue run. Since the default submission method is by way of SMTP (either from a MUA or by way of the Message Submission Program [MSP]), the value of \fBFastSplit\fR is seldom used to limit the number of processes to deliver the envelopes.

Host ordering makes better use of the connection cache, but may tend to process low priority messages that go to a single host over high priority messages that go to several hosts; it probably shouldn't be used on slow network links. Filename and modification time ordering saves the overhead of reading all of the queued items before starting the queue run. Creation (submission) time ordering is almost always a bad idea, since it allows large, bulk mail to go out before smaller, personal mail, but may have applicability on some hosts with very fast connections. Random is useful if several queue runners are started by hand which try to drain the same queue since odds are they are working on different parts of the queue at the same time. Priority ordering is the default.

This option can be set to \fBTrue\fR, \fBFalse\fR, \fBInteractive\fR, or \fBPostMilter\fR. If set to \fBTrue\fR, \fBsendmail\fR is set to super-safe when running things, that is, always instantiate the queue file, even if you are going to attempt immediate delivery. \fBsendmail\fR always instantiates the queue file before returning control to the client under any circumstances. This should really always be set to \fBTrue\fR. The \fBInteractive\fR value has been introduced in \fB8.12\fR and can be used together with \fBDeliveryMode=i\fR. It skips some synchronization calls which are effectively doubled in the code execution path for this mode. If set to \fBPostMilter\fR, \fBsendmail\fR defers synchronizing the queue file until any milters have signaled acceptance of the message. \fBPostMilter\fR is useful only when \fBsendmail\fR is running as an SMTP server; in all other situations it acts the same as True.

If you are the "best" (that is, lowest preference) \fBMX\fR for a given host, you should normally detect this situation and treat that condition specially, by forwarding the mail to a \fBUUCP\fR feed, treating it as local, or whatever. However, in some cases (such as Internet firewalls) you may want to try to connect directly to that host as though it had no \fBMX\fR records at all.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBsendmail\fR program requires a fully qualified host name when starting. A script has been included to help verify if the host name is defined properly (see \fBcheck-hostname\fR(8)).
.sp
.LP
The permissions and the ownership of several directories have been changed in order to increase security. In particular, access to \fB/etc/mail\fR and \fB/var/spool/mqueue\fR has been restricted.
.sp
.LP
Security restrictions have been placed users using \fB.forward\fR files to pipe mail to a program or redirect mail to a file. The default shell (as listed in \fB/etc/passwd\fR) of these users must be listed in \fB/etc/shells\fR. This restriction does not affect mail that is being redirected to another alias.
.sp
.LP
Additional restrictions have been put in place on \fB.forward\fR and \fB:include:\fR files. These files and the directory structure that they are placed in cannot be group- or world-writable. See \fBcheck-permissions\fR(8). 
.sp
.LP
If you have interfaces that map to domains that have MX records that point to non-local destinations, you might need to enable the \fBDontProbeInterfaces\fR option to enable delivery to those destinations. In its default startup behavior, \fBsendmail\fR probes each interface and adds an interface's \fBIP\fR addresses, as well as any domains that those addresses map to, to its list of domains that are considered local. For domains thus added, being on the list of local domains is equivalent to having a 0-preference MX record, with \fBlocalhost\fR as the MX value. If this is not the result you want, enable \fBDontProbeInterfaces\fR.
