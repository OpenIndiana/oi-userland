-Complex sites will need more local configuration information, such as
-lists of UUCP hosts they speak with directly.  This can get a bit more
-tricky.  For an example of a "complex" site, see cf/ucbvax.mc.
-
-The SITECONFIG macro allows you to indirectly reference site-dependent
-configuration information stored in the siteconfig subdirectory.  For
-example, the line
-
-	SITECONFIG(`uucp.ucbvax', `ucbvax', `U')
-
-reads the file uucp.ucbvax for local connection information.  The
-second parameter is the local name (in this case just "ucbvax" since
-it is locally connected, and hence a UUCP hostname).  The third
-parameter is the name of both a macro to store the local name (in
-this case, {U}) and the name of the class (e.g., {U}) in which to store
-the host information read from the file.  Another SITECONFIG line reads
-
-	SITECONFIG(`uucp.ucbarpa', `ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU', `W')
-
-This says that the file uucp.ucbarpa contains the list of UUCP sites
-connected to ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU.  Class {W} will be used to
-store this list, and $W is defined to be ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU, that
-is, the name of the relay to which the hosts listed in uucp.ucbarpa
-are connected.  [The machine ucbarpa is gone now, but this
-out-of-date configuration file has been left around to demonstrate
-how you might do this.]
-
-Note that the case of SITECONFIG with a third parameter of ``U'' is
-special; the second parameter is assumed to be the UUCP name of the
-local site, rather than the name of a remote site, and the UUCP name
-is entered into class {w} (the list of local hostnames) as $U.UUCP.
-
-The siteconfig file (e.g., siteconfig/uucp.ucbvax.m4) contains nothing
-more than a sequence of SITE macros describing connectivity.  For
-example:
-
-	SITE(`cnmat')
-	SITE(`sgi olympus')
-
-The second example demonstrates that you can use two names on the
-same line; these are usually aliases for the same host (or are at
-least in the same company).
-
-The macro LOCAL_UUCP can be used to add rules into the generated
-cf file at the place where MAILER(`uucp') inserts its rules.  This
-should only be used if really necessary.

-The macros ${auth_authen}, ${auth_author}, and ${auth_type} can be
-used in anti-relay rulesets to allow relaying for those users that
-authenticated themselves.  A very simple example is:
-
-SLocal_check_rcpt
-R$*		$: $&{auth_type}
-R$+		$# OK
-
-which checks whether a user has successfully authenticated using
-any available mechanism.  Depending on the setup of the Cyrus SASL
-library, more sophisticated rulesets might be required, e.g.,
-
-SLocal_check_rcpt
-R$*		$: $&{auth_type} $| $&{auth_authen}
-RDIGEST-MD5 $| $+@$=w	$# OK
-
-to allow relaying for users that authenticated using DIGEST-MD5
-and have an identity in the local domains.
-
-The ruleset trust_auth is used to determine whether a given AUTH=
-parameter (that is passed to this ruleset) should be trusted.  This
-ruleset may make use of the other ${auth_*} macros.  Only if the
-ruleset resolves to the error mailer, the AUTH= parameter is not
-trusted.  A user supplied ruleset Local_trust_auth can be written
-to modify the default behavior, which only trust the AUTH=
-parameter if it is identical to the authenticated user.
-
-Per default, relaying is allowed for any user who authenticated
-via a "trusted" mechanism, i.e., one that is defined via
-TRUST_AUTH_MECH(`list of mechanisms')
-For example:
-TRUST_AUTH_MECH(`KERBEROS_V4 DIGEST-MD5')
-
-If the selected mechanism provides a security layer the number of
-bits used for the key of the symmetric cipher is stored in the
-macro ${auth_ssf}.
-
-Providing SMTP AUTH Data when sendmail acts as Client
------------------------------------------------------
-
-If sendmail acts as client, it needs some information how to
-authenticate against another MTA.  This information can be provided
-by the ruleset authinfo or by the option DefaultAuthInfo.  The
-authinfo ruleset looks up {server_name} using the tag AuthInfo: in
-the access map.  If no entry is found, {server_addr} is looked up
-in the same way and finally just the tag AuthInfo: to provide
-default values.  Note: searches for domain parts or IP nets are
-only performed if the access map is used; if the authinfo feature
-is used then only up to three lookups are performed (two exact
-matches, one default).
-
-Note: If your daemon does client authentication when sending, and
-if it uses either PLAIN or LOGIN authentication, then you *must*
-prevent ordinary users from seeing verbose output.  Do NOT install
-sendmail set-user-ID.  Use PrivacyOptions to turn off verbose output
-("goaway" works for this).
-
-Notice: the default configuration file causes the option DefaultAuthInfo
-to fail since the ruleset authinfo is in the .cf file. If you really
-want to use DefaultAuthInfo (it is deprecated) then you have to
-remove the ruleset.
-
-The RHS for an AuthInfo: entry in the access map should consists of a
-list of tokens, each of which has the form: "TDstring" (including
-the quotes).  T is a tag which describes the item, D is a delimiter,
-either ':' for simple text or '=' for a base64 encoded string.
-Valid values for the tag are:
-
-	U	user (authorization) id
-	I	authentication id
-	P	password
-	R	realm
-	M	list of mechanisms delimited by spaces
-
-Example entries are:
-
-AuthInfo:other.dom "U:user" "I:user" "P:secret" "R:other.dom" "M:DIGEST-MD5"
-AuthInfo:host.more.dom "U:user" "P=c2VjcmV0"
-
-User id or authentication id must exist as well as the password.  All
-other entries have default values.  If one of user or authentication
-id is missing, the existing value is used for the missing item.
-If "R:" is not specified, realm defaults to $j.  The list of mechanisms
-defaults to those specified by AuthMechanisms.
-
-Since this map contains sensitive information, either the access
-map must be unreadable by everyone but root (or the trusted user)
-or FEATURE(`authinfo') must be used which provides a separate map.
-Notice: It is not checked whether the map is actually
-group/world-unreadable, this is left to the user.

-If the MSP should actually use AUTH then the necessary data
-should be placed in a map as explained in SMTP AUTHENTICATION:
-
-FEATURE(`authinfo', `DATABASE_MAP_TYPE /etc/mail/msp-authinfo')
-
-/etc/mail/msp-authinfo should contain an entry like:
-
-	AuthInfo:127.0.0.1	"U:smmsp" "P:secret" "M:DIGEST-MD5"
+workarounds.
 
 The file and the map created by makemap should be owned by smmsp,
-its group should be smmsp, and it should have mode 640.  The database
-used by the MTA for AUTH must have a corresponding entry.
-Additionally the MTA must trust this authentication data so the AUTH=
-part will be relayed on to the next hop.  This can be achieved by
-adding the following to your sendmail.mc file:
-
-	LOCAL_RULESETS
-	SLocal_trust_auth
-	R$*	$: $&{auth_authen}
-	Rsmmsp	$# OK
-
-Note: the authentication data can leak to local users who invoke
-the MSP with debug options or even with -v.  For that reason either
-an authentication mechanism that does not show the password in the
-AUTH dialogue (e.g., DIGEST-MD5) or a different authentication
-method like STARTTLS should be used.

 feature/msp.m4 defines almost all settings for the MSP.  Most of
 those should not be changed at all.  Some of the features and options
