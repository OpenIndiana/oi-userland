SAMFS header files (samfs/lib.h and samfs/stat.h) are only used to build Samba with
SAMFS support and they are not delivered by any Samba package.  The headers are taken
from SUNWsamfsr package, which delivers them to /opt/SUNWsamfs/include/. These headers
are part of system API, which handles operations specific to SAM-QFS file system.
