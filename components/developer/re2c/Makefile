COMPONENT_NAME=			re2c
COMPONENT_VERSION=		3.1
COMPONENT_REVISION=		1
COMPONENT_SUMMARY=		re2c is a free and open-source lexer generator for C, C++ and Go.
COMPONENT_DESCRIPTION=	Its main goal is generating fast lexers: at least as \
	fast as their reasonably optimized hand-coded counterparts. Instead of \
	using traditional table-driven approach, re2c encodes the generated finite \
	state automata directly in the form of conditional jumps and comparisons. \
	The resulting programs are faster and often smaller than their table-driven analogues, \
	and they are much easier to debug and understand. re2c applies quite a few \
	optimizations in order to speed up and compress the generated code. \
	Another distinctive feature is its flexible interface: instead of assuming a \
	fixed program template, re2c lets the programmer write most of the interface code \
	and adapt the generated lexer to any particular environment.
