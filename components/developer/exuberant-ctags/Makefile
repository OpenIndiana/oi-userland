COMPONENT_NAME=		exuberant-ctags
COMPONENT_VERSION=	5.8
COMPONENT_REVISION=	1
COMPONENT_PROJECT_URL=	https://ctags.sourceforge.net/
COMPONENT_SUMMARY=	A C programming language indexing and/or cross-reference tool
COMPONENT_DESCRIPTION=	\
Ctags generates an index (or tag) file of C language objects found in \
C source and header files.  The index makes it easy for text editors or \
other utilities to locate the indexed items.  Ctags can also generate a \
cross reference file which lists information about the various objects \
found in a set of C language files in human readable form.  Exuberant \
Ctags improves on ctags because it can find all types of C language tags, \
including macro definitions, enumerated values (values inside enum{...}), \
function and method definitions, enum/struct/union tags, external \
function prototypes, typedef names and variable declarations.  Exuberant \
Ctags is far less likely to be fooled by code containing \#if preprocessor \
conditional constructs than ctags.  Exuberant ctags supports output of \
Emacs style TAGS files and can be used to print out a list of selected \
objects found in source files.
