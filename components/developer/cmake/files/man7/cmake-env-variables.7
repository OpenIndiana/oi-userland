.sp
This page lists environment variables that have special
meaning to CMake.
.sp
For general information on environment variables, see the
\fIEnvironment Variables\fP
section in the cmake\-language manual.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES THAT CONTROL THE BUILD
.SS CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL
.sp
This is a CMake \fIEnvironment Variable\fP\&. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.
.sp
Specifies the maximum number of concurrent processes to use when building
using the \fBcmake \-\-build\fP command line
\fIBuild Tool Mode\fP\&.
.sp
If this variable is defined empty the native build tool\(aqs default number is
used.
.SS CMAKE_CONFIG_TYPE
.sp
This is a CMake \fIEnvironment Variable\fP\&. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.
.sp
The default build configuration for \fIBuild Tool Mode\fP and
\fBctest\fP build handler when there is no explicit configuration given.
.SS CMAKE_GENERATOR
.sp
This is a CMake \fIEnvironment Variable\fP\&. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.
.sp
Specifies the CMake default generator to use when no generator is supplied
with \fB\-G\fP\&. If the provided value doesn\(aqt name a generator known by CMake,
the internal default is used.  Either way the resulting generator selection
is stored in the \fBCMAKE_GENERATOR\fP variable.
.sp
Some generators may be additionally configured using the environment
variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE\fP
.UNINDENT
.SS CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE
.sp
This is a CMake \fIEnvironment Variable\fP\&. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.
.sp
Default value for \fBCMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE\fP if no Cache entry is
present. This value is only applied if \fBCMAKE_GENERATOR\fP is set.
.SS CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM
.sp
This is a CMake \fIEnvironment Variable\fP\&. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.
.sp
Default value for \fBCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM\fP if no Cache entry
is present and no value is specified by \fBcmake(1)\fP \fB\-A\fP option.
This value is only applied if \fBCMAKE_GENERATOR\fP is set.
.SS CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET
.sp
This is a CMake \fIEnvironment Variable\fP\&. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.
.sp
Default value for \fBCMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET\fP if no Cache entry
is present and no value is specified by \fBcmake(1)\fP \fB\-T\fP option.
This value is only applied if \fBCMAKE_GENERATOR\fP is set.
.SS CMAKE_MSVCIDE_RUN_PATH
.sp
This is a CMake \fIEnvironment Variable\fP\&. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.
.sp
Extra PATH locations for custom commands when using
\fBVisual Studio 9 2008\fP (or above) generators.
.sp
The \fBCMAKE_MSVCIDE_RUN_PATH\fP environment variable sets the default value for
the \fBCMAKE_MSVCIDE_RUN_PATH\fP variable if not already explicitly set.
.SS CMAKE_NO_VERBOSE
.sp
Disables verbose output from CMake when \fBVERBOSE\fP environment variable
is set.
.sp
Only your build tool of choice will still print verbose output when you start
to actually build your project.
.SS CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES
.sp
This is a CMake \fIEnvironment Variable\fP\&. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.
.sp
Target specific architectures for macOS.
.sp
The \fBCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES\fP environment variable sets the default value for
the \fBCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES\fP variable. See
\fBOSX_ARCHITECTURES\fP for more information.
.SS DESTDIR
.sp
This is a CMake \fIEnvironment Variable\fP\&. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.
.sp
On UNIX one can use the \fBDESTDIR\fP mechanism in order to relocate the
whole installation.  \fBDESTDIR\fP means DESTination DIRectory.  It is
commonly used by makefile users in order to install software at
non\-default location.  It is usually invoked like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
make DESTDIR=/home/john install
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
which will install the concerned software using the installation
prefix, e.g.  \fB/usr/local\fP prepended with the \fBDESTDIR\fP value which
finally gives \fB/home/john/usr/local\fP\&.
.sp
WARNING: \fBDESTDIR\fP may not be used on Windows because installation
prefix usually contains a drive letter like in \fBC:/Program Files\fP
which cannot be prepended with some other prefix.
.SS LDFLAGS
.sp
This is a CMake \fIEnvironment Variable\fP\&. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.
.sp

linker flags, after which the value for \fBLDFLAGS\fP is stored in the cache
as \fBCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT\fP,
\fBCMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT\fP, and
\fBCMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT\fP\&. For any configuration run
(including the first), the environment variable will be ignored if the
equivalent  \fBCMAKE_<TYPE>_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT\fP variable is defined.
.SS MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET
.sp
This is a CMake \fIEnvironment Variable\fP\&. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.
.sp
Specify the minimum version of macOS on which the target binaries are
to be deployed.
.sp
The \fBMACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET\fP environment variable sets the default value for
the \fBCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET\fP variable.
.SS <PackageName>_ROOT
.sp
This is a CMake \fIEnvironment Variable\fP\&. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.
.sp
Calls to \fBfind_package(<PackageName>)\fP will search in prefixes
specified by the \fB<PackageName>_ROOT\fP environment variable, where
\fB<PackageName>\fP is the name given to the \fBfind_package()\fP call
and \fB_ROOT\fP is literal.  For example, \fBfind_package(Foo)\fP will search
prefixes specified in the \fBFoo_ROOT\fP environment variable (if set).
See policy \fBCMP0074\fP\&.
.sp
This variable may hold a single prefix or a list of prefixes separated
by \fB:\fP on UNIX or \fB;\fP on Windows (the same as the \fBPATH\fP environment
variable convention on those platforms).
.sp
See also the \fB<PackageName>_ROOT\fP CMake variable.
.SS VERBOSE
.sp
Activates verbose output from CMake and your build tools of choice when
you start to actually build your project.
.sp
Note that any given value is ignored. It\(aqs just checked for existence.

.sp
This is a CMake \fIEnvironment Variable\fP\&. Its initial value is taken from

See \fBctest(1)\fP for more information on controlling output of failed
