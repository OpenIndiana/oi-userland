.SH PROPERTIES OF GLOBAL SCOPE
.SS ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS
.sp
Allow duplicate custom targets to be created.
.sp
Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a project have
globally unique logical names (see policy CMP0002).  This is necessary
to generate meaningful project file names in Xcode and VS IDE
generators.  It also allows the target names to be referenced
unambiguously.
.sp
Makefile generators are capable of supporting duplicate custom target
names.  For projects that care only about Makefile generators and do
not wish to support Xcode or VS IDE generators, one may set this
property to true to allow duplicate custom targets.  The property
allows multiple add_custom_target command calls in different
directories to specify the same target name.  However, setting this
property will cause non\-Makefile generators to produce an error and
refuse to generate the project.
.SS AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER
.sp
Name of \fBFOLDER\fP for \fB*_automoc\fP targets that are added automatically by
CMake for targets for which \fBAUTOMOC\fP is enabled.
.sp
If not set, CMake uses the \fBFOLDER\fP property of the parent target as a
default value for this property.  See also the documentation for the
\fBFOLDER\fP target property and the \fBAUTOMOC\fP target property.
.SS AUTOMOC_TARGETS_FOLDER
.sp
Name of \fBFOLDER\fP for \fB*_automoc\fP targets that are added automatically by
CMake for targets for which \fBAUTOMOC\fP is enabled.
.sp
This property is obsolete.  Use \fBAUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER\fP instead.
.sp
If not set, CMake uses the \fBFOLDER\fP property of the parent target as a
default value for this property.  See also the documentation for the
\fBFOLDER\fP target property and the \fBAUTOMOC\fP target property.
.SS CMAKE_C_KNOWN_FEATURES
.sp

.UNINDENT
.SS DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS
.sp
Specify which configurations are for debugging.
.sp
The value must be a semi\-colon separated list of configuration names.
Currently this property is used only by the target_link_libraries
command (see its documentation for details).  Additional uses may be
defined in the future.
.sp
This property must be set at the top level of the project and before
the first target_link_libraries command invocation.  If any entry in
the list does not match a valid configuration for the project the
behavior is undefined.
.SS DISABLED_FEATURES
.sp
List of features which are disabled during the CMake run.
.sp
List of features which are disabled during the CMake run.  By default
it contains the names of all packages which were not found.  This is
determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.  Packages which are
searched QUIET are not listed.  A project can add its own features to
this list.  This property is used by the macros in
FeatureSummary.cmake.
.SS ENABLED_FEATURES
.sp
List of features which are enabled during the CMake run.
.sp
List of features which are enabled during the CMake run.  By default
it contains the names of all packages which were found.  This is
determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.  Packages which are
searched QUIET are not listed.  A project can add its own features to
this list.  This property is used by the macros in
FeatureSummary.cmake.
.SS ENABLED_LANGUAGES
.sp
Read\-only property that contains the list of currently enabled languages
.sp
Set to list of currently enabled languages.
.SS FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS
.sp
Whether FIND_LIBRARY should automatically search lib64 directories.
.sp
FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS is a boolean specifying whether the
FIND_LIBRARY command should automatically search the lib64 variant of
directories called lib in the search path when building 64\-bit
binaries.
.SS FIND_LIBRARY_USE_OPENBSD_VERSIONING
.sp
Whether FIND_LIBRARY should find OpenBSD\-style shared libraries.
.sp
This property is a boolean specifying whether the FIND_LIBRARY command
should find shared libraries with OpenBSD\-style versioned extension:
".so.<major>.<minor>".  The property is set to true on OpenBSD and
false on other platforms.
.SS GLOBAL_DEPENDS_DEBUG_MODE
.sp
Enable global target dependency graph debug mode.
.sp
CMake automatically analyzes the global inter\-target dependency graph
at the beginning of native build system generation.  This property
causes it to display details of its analysis to stderr.
.SS GLOBAL_DEPENDS_NO_CYCLES
.sp
Disallow global target dependency graph cycles.
.sp
CMake automatically analyzes the global inter\-target dependency graph
at the beginning of native build system generation.  It reports an
error if the dependency graph contains a cycle that does not consist
of all STATIC library targets.  This property tells CMake to disallow
all cycles completely, even among static libraries.
.SS IN_TRY_COMPILE
.sp
Read\-only property that is true during a try\-compile configuration.
.sp
True when building a project inside a TRY_COMPILE or TRY_RUN command.
.SS PACKAGES_FOUND
.sp
List of packages which were found during the CMake run.
.sp
List of packages which were found during the CMake run.  Whether a
package has been found is determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.
.SS PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND
.sp
List of packages which were not found during the CMake run.
.sp
List of packages which were not found during the CMake run.  Whether a
package has been found is determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.
.SS JOB_POOLS
.sp
Ninja only: List of available pools.
.sp
A pool is a named integer property and defines the maximum number
of concurrent jobs which can be started by a rule assigned to the pool.
The \fI\%JOB_POOLS\fP property is a semicolon\-separated list of
pairs using the syntax NAME=integer (without a space after the equality sign).
.sp
For instance:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set_property(GLOBAL PROPERTY JOB_POOLS two_jobs=2 ten_jobs=10)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Defined pools could be used globally by setting
\fBCMAKE_JOB_POOL_COMPILE\fP and \fBCMAKE_JOB_POOL_LINK\fP
or per target by setting the target properties
\fBJOB_POOL_COMPILE\fP and \fBJOB_POOL_LINK\fP\&.
.sp
Build targets provided by CMake that are meant for individual interactive
use, such as \fBinstall\fP, are placed in the \fBconsole\fP pool automatically.
.SS PREDEFINED_TARGETS_FOLDER
.sp
Name of FOLDER for targets that are added automatically by CMake.
.sp
If not set, CMake uses "CMakePredefinedTargets" as a default value for
this property.  Targets such as INSTALL, PACKAGE and RUN_TESTS will be
organized into this FOLDER.  See also the documentation for the FOLDER
target property.
.SS ECLIPSE_EXTRA_NATURES
.sp
List of natures to add to the generated Eclipse project file.
.sp
Eclipse projects specify language plugins by using natures. This property
should be set to the unique identifier for a nature (which looks like a Java
package name).
.SS REPORT_UNDEFINED_PROPERTIES
.sp
If set, report any undefined properties to this file.
.sp
If this property is set to a filename then when CMake runs it will
report any properties or variables that were accessed but not defined
into the filename specified in this property.
.SS RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
.sp
Specify a launcher for compile rules.
.sp
Makefile generators prefix compiler commands with the given launcher
command line.  This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build
problems with high granularity.  Non\-Makefile generators currently
ignore this property.
.SS RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
.sp
Specify a launcher for custom rules.
.sp
Makefile generators prefix custom commands with the given launcher
command line.  This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build
problems with high granularity.  Non\-Makefile generators currently
ignore this property.
.SS RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
.sp
Specify a launcher for link rules.
.sp
Makefile generators prefix link and archive commands with the given
launcher command line.  This is intended to allow launchers to
intercept build problems with high granularity.  Non\-Makefile
generators currently ignore this property.
.SS RULE_MESSAGES
.sp
Specify whether to report a message for each make rule.
.sp
This property specifies whether Makefile generators should add a
progress message describing what each build rule does.  If the
property is not set the default is ON.  Set the property to OFF to
disable granular messages and report only as each target completes.
This is intended to allow scripted builds to avoid the build time cost
of detailed reports.  If a CMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES cache entry exists its
value initializes the value of this property.  Non\-Makefile generators
currently ignore this property.
.SS TARGET_ARCHIVES_MAY_BE_SHARED_LIBS
.sp
Set if shared libraries may be named like archives.
.sp
On AIX shared libraries may be named "lib<name>.a".  This property is
set to true on such platforms.
.SS TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS
.sp
Does the target platform support shared libraries.
.sp
TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS is a boolean specifying whether the target
platform supports shared libraries.  Basically all current general
general purpose OS do so, the exception are usually embedded systems
with no or special OSs.
.SS USE_FOLDERS
.sp
Use the FOLDER target property to organize targets into folders.
.sp
If not set, CMake treats this property as OFF by default.  CMake
generators that are capable of organizing into a hierarchy of folders
use the values of the FOLDER target property to name those folders.
See also the documentation for the FOLDER target property.
.SH PROPERTIES ON DIRECTORIES
.SS ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES
.sp
Additional files to clean during the make clean stage.
.sp
A list of files that will be cleaned as a part of the "make clean"
stage.
.SS CACHE_VARIABLES
.sp
List of cache variables available in the current directory.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the list of CMake cache variables
currently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.
.SS CLEAN_NO_CUSTOM
.sp
Should the output of custom commands be left.
.sp
If this is true then the outputs of custom commands for this directory
will not be removed during the "make clean" stage.
.SS CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS
.sp
Tell CMake about additional input files to the configuration process.
If any named file is modified the build system will re\-run CMake to
re\-configure the file and generate the build system again.
.sp
Specify files as a semicolon\-separated list of paths.  Relative paths
are interpreted as relative to the current source directory.
.SS COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
.sp
Preprocessor definitions for compiling a directory\(aqs sources.
.sp
This property specifies the list of options given so far to the
\fBadd_definitions()\fP command.
.sp
The \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP property may be set to a semicolon\-separated
list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax \fBVAR\fP or \fBVAR=value\fP\&.
Function\-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will
automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system
(note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some
values).
.sp
This property will be initialized in each directory by its value in the
directory\(aqs parent.
.sp
CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
by the native build tool.  The VS6 IDE does not support definition
values with spaces (but NMake does).
.sp
Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
certain values.  CMake has work\-arounds for many cases but some values
may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem
to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work\-around the problem by
adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work\-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead
consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then
report the limitation.  Known limitations include:
.INDENT 0.0

Contents of \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP
manual for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.sp
The corresponding \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>\fP property may
be set to specify per\-configuration definitions.  Generator expressions
should be preferred instead of setting the alternative property.
.SS COMPILE_OPTIONS
.sp
List of options to pass to the compiler.
.sp
This property holds a ;\-list of options
given so far to the \fBadd_compile_options()\fP command.
.sp
This property is used to initialize the \fBCOMPILE_OPTIONS\fP target
property when a target is created, which is used by the generators to set
the options for the compiler.
.sp
Contents of \fBCOMPILE_OPTIONS\fP may use "generator expressions" with the
syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP manual
for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS DEFINITIONS
.sp
For CMake 2.4 compatibility only.  Use \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP
instead.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the list of flags given so far to
the \fBadd_definitions()\fP command.  It is intended for debugging
purposes.  Use the \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP directory property
instead.
.sp
This built\-in read\-only property does not exist if policy
\fBCMP0059\fP is set to \fBNEW\fP\&.
.SS EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
.sp
Exclude the directory from the all target of its parent.
.sp
A property on a directory that indicates if its targets are excluded
from the default build target.  If it is not, then with a Makefile for
example typing make will cause the targets to be built.  The same
concept applies to the default build of other generators.
.SS IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM
.sp
Specify #include line transforms for dependencies in a directory.
.sp
This property specifies rules to transform macro\-like #include lines
during implicit dependency scanning of C and C++ source files.  The
list of rules must be semicolon\-separated with each entry of the form
"A_MACRO(%)=value\-with\-%" (the % must be literal).  During dependency
scanning occurrences of A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be
replaced by the value given with the macro argument substituted for
\(aq%\(aq.  For example, the entry
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
MYDIR(%)=<mydir/%>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

allowing the dependency to be followed.
.sp
This property applies to sources in all targets within a directory.
The property value is initialized in each directory by its value in
the directory\(aqs parent.
.SS INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
.sp
List of preprocessor include file search directories.
.sp
This property specifies the list of directories given so far to the
\fBinclude_directories()\fP command.
.sp
This property is used to populate the \fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP
target property, which is used by the generators to set the include
directories for the compiler.
.sp
In addition to accepting values from that command, values may be set
directly on any directory using the \fBset_property()\fP command.  A
directory gets its initial value from its parent directory if it has one.
The intial value of the \fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP target property
comes from the value of this property.  Both directory and target property
values are adjusted by calls to the \fBinclude_directories()\fP command.
.sp
The target property values are used by the generators to set the
include paths for the compiler.
.sp
Contents of \fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP
manual for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
.sp
Include file scanning regular expression.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the regular expression used during
dependency scanning to match include files that should be followed.
See the include_regular_expression command.
.SS INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>
.sp

.sp
This is a per\-configuration version of INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION.
If set, this property overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.
.SS INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
.sp
Enable interprocedural optimization for targets in a directory.
.sp
If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are
known to be supported by the compiler.
.SS LINK_DIRECTORIES
.sp
List of linker search directories.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the list of directories given so far
to the link_directories command.  It is intended for debugging
purposes.
.SS LISTFILE_STACK
.sp
The current stack of listfiles being processed.
.sp
This property is mainly useful when trying to debug errors in your
CMake scripts.  It returns a list of what list files are currently
being processed, in order.  So if one listfile does an INCLUDE command
then that is effectively pushing the included listfile onto the stack.
.SS MACROS
.sp
List of macro commands available in the current directory.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the list of CMake macros currently
defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.  See the macro
command.
.SS PARENT_DIRECTORY
.sp
Source directory that added current subdirectory.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the source directory that added the
current source directory as a subdirectory of the build.  In the
top\-level directory the value is the empty\-string.
.SS RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
.sp
Specify a launcher for compile rules.
.sp
See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global property for a directory.
.SS RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
.sp
Specify a launcher for custom rules.
.sp
See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global property for a directory.
.SS RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
.sp
Specify a launcher for link rules.
.sp
See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global property for a directory.
.SS TEST_INCLUDE_FILE
.sp
A cmake file that will be included when ctest is run.
.sp
If you specify TEST_INCLUDE_FILE, that file will be included and
processed when ctest is run on the directory.
.SS VARIABLES
.sp
List of variables defined in the current directory.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the list of CMake variables
currently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.
.SS VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_<section>
.sp
Specify a postSolution global section in Visual Studio.
.sp
Setting a property like this generates an entry of the following form
in the solution file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
GlobalSection(<section>) = postSolution
  <contents based on property value>
EndGlobalSection
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The property must be set to a semicolon\-separated list of key=value
pairs.  Each such pair will be transformed into an entry in the
solution global section.  Whitespace around key and value is ignored.
List elements which do not contain an equal sign are skipped.
.sp
This property only works for Visual Studio 7 and above; it is ignored
on other generators.  The property only applies when set on a
directory whose CMakeLists.txt contains a project() command.
.sp
Note that CMake generates postSolution sections ExtensibilityGlobals
and ExtensibilityAddIns by default.  If you set the corresponding
property, it will override the default section.  For example, setting
VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_ExtensibilityGlobals will override the default
contents of the ExtensibilityGlobals section, while keeping
ExtensibilityAddIns on its default.
.SS VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_PRE_<section>
.sp
Specify a preSolution global section in Visual Studio.
.sp
Setting a property like this generates an entry of the following form
in the solution file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
GlobalSection(<section>) = preSolution
  <contents based on property value>
EndGlobalSection
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The property must be set to a semicolon\-separated list of key=value
pairs.  Each such pair will be transformed into an entry in the
solution global section.  Whitespace around key and value is ignored.
List elements which do not contain an equal sign are skipped.
.sp
This property only works for Visual Studio 7 and above; it is ignored
on other generators.  The property only applies when set on a
directory whose CMakeLists.txt contains a project() command.
.SH PROPERTIES ON TARGETS
.SS ALIASED_TARGET
.sp
Name of target aliased by this target.
.sp
If this is an Alias Target, this property contains
the name of the target aliased.
.SS ANDROID_API
.sp
Set the Android Target API version (e.g. \fB15\fP).  The version number
must be a positive decimal integer.  This property is initialized by
the value of the \fBCMAKE_ANDROID_API\fP variable if it is set
when a target is created.
.SS ANDROID_API_MIN
.sp
Set the Android MIN API version (e.g. \fB9\fP).  The version number
must be a positive decimal integer.  This property is initialized by
the value of the \fBCMAKE_ANDROID_API_MIN\fP variable if it is set
when a target is created.  Native code builds using this API version.
.SS ANDROID_GUI
.sp
Build an executable as an application package on Android.
.sp
When this property is set to true the executable when built for Android
will be created as an application package.  This property is initialized
by the value of the \fBCMAKE_ANDROID_GUI\fP variable if it is set
when a target is created.
.sp
Add the \fBAndroidManifest.xml\fP source file explicitly to the
target \fBadd_executable()\fP command invocation to specify the
root directory of the application package source.
.SS ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration output directory for
ARCHIVE target files.
.sp
This is a per\-configuration version of the
\fBARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\fP target property, but
multi\-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) do NOT append a
per\-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This
property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>\fP variable if
it is set when a target is created.
.SS ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
.sp
Output directory in which to build ARCHIVE target files.
.sp
This property specifies the directory into which archive target files
should be built.  Multi\-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) append a
per\-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is created.
.sp
See also the \fBARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>\fP target property.
.SS ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration output name for
ARCHIVE target files.
.sp
This is the configuration\-specific version of the
\fBARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME\fP target property.
.SS ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME
.sp
Output name for ARCHIVE target files.
.sp
This property specifies the base name for archive target files.  It
overrides \fBOUTPUT_NAME\fP and \fBOUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>\fP
properties.
.sp
See also the \fBARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>\fP target property.
.SS AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS
.sp
Target dependencies of the corresponding \fB_automoc\fP target.
.sp
Targets which have their \fBAUTOMOC\fP target \fBON\fP have a
corresponding \fB_automoc\fP target which is used to autogenerate generate moc
files.  As this \fB_automoc\fP target is created at generate\-time, it is not
possible to define dependencies of it, such as to create inputs for the \fBmoc\fP
executable.
.sp
The \fBAUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS\fP target property can be set instead to a list of
dependencies for the \fB_automoc\fP target.  The buildsystem will be generated to
depend on its contents.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-qt(7)\fP manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
.SS AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS
.sp
Additional options for moc when using \fBAUTOMOC\fP
.sp
This property is only used if the \fBAUTOMOC\fP property is \fBON\fP
for this target.  In this case, it holds additional command line
options which will be used when \fBmoc\fP is executed during the build, i.e.
it is equivalent to the optional \fBOPTIONS\fP argument of the
\fBqt4_wrap_cpp()\fP macro.
.sp
By default it is empty.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-qt(7)\fP manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
.SS AUTOMOC
.sp
Should the target be processed with automoc (for Qt projects).
.sp
AUTOMOC is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle the Qt \fBmoc\fP
preprocessor automatically, i.e.  without having to use the
\fBQT4_WRAP_CPP()\fP or QT5_WRAP_CPP() macro.  Currently Qt4 and Qt5 are
supported.  When this property is set \fBON\fP, CMake will scan the
source files at build time and invoke moc accordingly.  If an \fB#include\fP
statement like \fB#include "moc_foo.cpp"\fP is found, the \fBQ_OBJECT\fP class
declaration is expected in the header, and \fBmoc\fP is run on the header
file.  If an \fB#include\fP statement like \fB#include "foo.moc"\fP is found, then
a \fBQ_OBJECT\fP is expected in the current source file and \fBmoc\fP is run on
the file itself.  Additionally, header files with the same base name (like
\fBfoo.h\fP) or \fB_p\fP appended to the base name (like \fBfoo_p.h\fP) are parsed
for \fBQ_OBJECT\fP macros, and if found, \fBmoc\fP is also executed on those files.
\fBAUTOMOC\fP checks multiple header alternative extensions, such as
\fBhpp\fP, \fBhxx\fP etc when searching for headers.
The resulting moc files, which are not included as shown above in any
of the source files are included in a generated
\fB<targetname>_automoc.cpp\fP file, which is compiled as part of the
target.  This property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_AUTOMOC\fP variable if it is set when a target is created.
.sp
Additional command line options for moc can be set via the
\fBAUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS\fP property.
.sp
By enabling the \fBCMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE\fP variable the
rules for searching the files which will be processed by moc can be relaxed.
See the documentation for this variable for more details.
.sp
The global property \fBAUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER\fP can be used to group the
automoc targets together in an IDE, e.g.  in MSVS.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-qt(7)\fP manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
.SS AUTOUIC
.sp
Should the target be processed with autouic (for Qt projects).
.sp
\fBAUTOUIC\fP is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle
the Qt \fBuic\fP code generator automatically, i.e. without having to use
the \fBQT4_WRAP_UI()\fP or \fBQT5_WRAP_UI()\fP macro. Currently
Qt4 and Qt5 are supported.
.sp
When this property is \fBON\fP, CMake will scan the source files at build time
and invoke \fBuic\fP accordingly.  If an \fB#include\fP statement like
\fB#include "ui_foo.h"\fP is found in \fBfoo.cpp\fP, a \fBfoo.ui\fP file is
expected next to \fBfoo.cpp\fP, and \fBuic\fP is run on the \fBfoo.ui\fP file.
This property is initialized by the value of the \fBCMAKE_AUTOUIC\fP
variable if it is set when a target is created.
.sp
Additional command line options for \fBuic\fP can be set via the
\fBAUTOUIC_OPTIONS\fP source file property on the \fBfoo.ui\fP file.
The global property \fBAUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER\fP can be used to group the
autouic targets together in an IDE, e.g. in MSVS.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-qt(7)\fP manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
.SS AUTOUIC_OPTIONS
.sp
Additional options for uic when using \fBAUTOUIC\fP
.sp
This property holds additional command line options which will be used when
\fBuic\fP is executed during the build via \fBAUTOUIC\fP, i.e. it is
equivalent to the optional \fBOPTIONS\fP argument of the
\fBqt4_wrap_ui()\fP macro.
.sp
By default it is empty.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS\fP variable if it is set when a target is
created.
.sp
The options set on the target may be overridden by \fBAUTOUIC_OPTIONS\fP
set on the \fB\&.ui\fP source file.
.sp
This property may use "generator expressions" with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.
See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP manual for available
expressions.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-qt(7)\fP manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
.SS AUTORCC
.sp
Should the target be processed with autorcc (for Qt projects).
.sp
\fBAUTORCC\fP is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle
the Qt \fBrcc\fP code generator automatically, i.e. without having to use
the \fBQT4_ADD_RESOURCES()\fP or \fBQT5_ADD_RESOURCES()\fP
macro.  Currently Qt4 and Qt5 are supported.
.sp
When this property is \fBON\fP, CMake will handle \fB\&.qrc\fP files added
as target sources at build time and invoke \fBrcc\fP accordingly.
This property is initialized by the value of the \fBCMAKE_AUTORCC\fP
variable if it is set when a target is created.
.sp
Additional command line options for rcc can be set via the
\fBAUTORCC_OPTIONS\fP source file property on the \fB\&.qrc\fP file.
.sp
The global property \fBAUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER\fP can be used to group
the autorcc targets together in an IDE, e.g. in MSVS.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-qt(7)\fP manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
.SS AUTORCC_OPTIONS
.sp
Additional options for \fBrcc\fP when using \fBAUTORCC\fP
.sp
This property holds additional command line options which will be used
when \fBrcc\fP is executed during the build via \fBAUTORCC\fP,
i.e. it is equivalent to the optional \fBOPTIONS\fP argument of the
\fBqt4_add_resources()\fP macro.
.sp
By default it is empty.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_AUTORCC_OPTIONS\fP variable if it is set when a target is
created.
.sp
The options set on the target may be overridden by \fBAUTORCC_OPTIONS\fP
set on the \fB\&.qrc\fP source file.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-qt(7)\fP manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
.SS BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
.sp
Should build tree targets have install tree rpaths.
.sp
BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to link the
target in the build tree with the INSTALL_RPATH.  This takes
precedence over SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the need for relinking
before installation.  This property is initialized by the value of the
variable CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH if it is set when a target is
created.
.SS BUNDLE_EXTENSION
.sp
The file extension used to name a BUNDLE target on the Mac.
.sp
The default value is "bundle" \- you can also use "plugin" or whatever
file extension is required by the host app for your bundle.
.SS BUNDLE
.sp
This target is a CFBundle on the Mac.
.sp
If a module library target has this property set to true it will be
built as a CFBundle when built on the mac.  It will have the directory
structure required for a CFBundle and will be suitable to be used for
creating Browser Plugins or other application resources.
.SS C_EXTENSIONS
.sp
Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.
.sp
This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be
used.  For some compilers, this results in adding a flag such
as \fB\-std=gnu11\fP instead of \fB\-std=c11\fP to the compile line.  This
property is \fBON\fP by default.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \fBCMAKE_C_EXTENSIONS\fP variable if it is set when a target
is created.
.SS C_STANDARD
.sp
The C standard whose features are requested to build this target.
.sp
This property specifies the C standard whose features are requested
to build this target.  For some compilers, this results in adding a
flag such as \fB\-std=gnu11\fP to the compile line.  For compilers that
have no notion of a standard level, such as MSVC, this has no effect.
.sp
Supported values are \fB90\fP, \fB99\fP and \fB11\fP\&.
.sp
If the value requested does not result in a compile flag being added for
the compiler in use, a previous standard flag will be added instead.  This
means that using:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY C_STANDARD 11)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
with a compiler which does not support \fB\-std=gnu11\fP or an equivalent
flag will not result in an error or warning, but will instead add the
\fB\-std=gnu99\fP or \fB\-std=gnu90\fP flag if supported.  This "decay" behavior may
be controlled with the \fBC_STANDARD_REQUIRED\fP target property.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \fBCMAKE_C_STANDARD\fP variable if it is set when a target
is created.
.SS C_STANDARD_REQUIRED
.sp
Boolean describing whether the value of \fBC_STANDARD\fP is a requirement.
.sp
If this property is set to \fBON\fP, then the value of the
\fBC_STANDARD\fP target property is treated as a requirement.  If this
property is \fBOFF\fP or unset, the \fBC_STANDARD\fP target property is
treated as optional and may "decay" to a previous standard if the requested is
not available.  For compilers that have no notion of a standard level, such as
MSVC, this has no effect.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \fBCMAKE_C_STANDARD_REQUIRED\fP variable if it is set when a
target is created.
.SS COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL
.sp
Properties which must be compatible with their link interface
.sp
The \fBCOMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL\fP property may contain a list of
properties for this target which must be consistent when evaluated as a
boolean with the \fBINTERFACE\fP variant of the property in all linked
dependees.  For example, if a property \fBFOO\fP appears in the list, then
for each dependee, the \fBINTERFACE_FOO\fP property content in all of its
dependencies must be consistent with each other, and with the \fBFOO\fP
property in the depender.
.sp
Consistency in this sense has the meaning that if the property is set,
then it must have the same boolean value as all others, and if the
property is not set, then it is ignored.
.sp
Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
Compatible Interface Properties\&.
.SS COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX
.sp
Properties whose maximum value from the link interface will be used.
.sp
The \fBCOMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX\fP property may contain a list of
properties for this target whose maximum value may be read at generate
time when evaluated in the \fBINTERFACE\fP variant of the property in all
linked dependees.  For example, if a property \fBFOO\fP appears in the list,
then for each dependee, the \fBINTERFACE_FOO\fP property content in all of
its dependencies will be compared with each other and with the \fBFOO\fP
property in the depender.  When reading the \fBFOO\fP property at generate
time, the maximum value will be returned. If the property is not set,
then it is ignored.
.sp
Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
Compatible Interface Properties\&.
.SS COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN
.sp
Properties whose maximum value from the link interface will be used.
.sp
The \fBCOMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN\fP property may contain a list of
properties for this target whose minimum value may be read at generate
time when evaluated in the \fBINTERFACE\fP variant of the property of all
linked dependees.  For example, if a
property \fBFOO\fP appears in the list, then for each dependee, the
\fBINTERFACE_FOO\fP property content in all of its dependencies will be
compared with each other and with the \fBFOO\fP property in the depender.
When reading the \fBFOO\fP property at generate time, the minimum value
will be returned.  If the property is not set, then it is ignored.
.sp
Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
Compatible Interface Properties\&.
.SS COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING
.sp
Properties which must be string\-compatible with their link interface
.sp
The \fBCOMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING\fP property may contain a list of
properties for this target which must be the same when evaluated as a
string in the \fBINTERFACE\fP variant of the property all linked dependees.
For example, if a property \fBFOO\fP appears in the list, then for each
dependee, the \fBINTERFACE_FOO\fP property content in all of its
dependencies must be equal with each other, and with the \fBFOO\fP property
in the depender.  If the property is not set, then it is ignored.
.sp
Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
Compatible Interface Properties\&.
.SS COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
.sp
Preprocessor definitions for compiling a target\(aqs sources.
.sp
The \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP property may be set to a semicolon\-separated
list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax \fBVAR\fP or \fBVAR=value\fP\&.
Function\-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will
automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system
(note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some
values).
.sp
CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
by the native build tool.  The VS6 IDE does not support definition
values with spaces (but NMake does).
.sp
Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
certain values.  CMake has work\-arounds for many cases but some values
may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem
to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work\-around the problem by
adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work\-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead
consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then
report the limitation.  Known limitations include:

The corresponding \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>\fP property may
be set to specify per\-configuration definitions.  Generator expressions
should be preferred instead of setting the alternative property.
.SS COMPILE_FEATURES
.sp
Compiler features enabled for this target.
.sp
The list of features in this property are a subset of the features listed
in the \fBCMAKE_CXX_COMPILE_FEATURES\fP variable.

.sp
The COMPILE_FLAGS property sets additional compiler flags used to
build sources within the target.  Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to pass
additional preprocessor definitions.
.sp
This property is deprecated.  Use the COMPILE_OPTIONS property or the
target_compile_options command instead.
.SS COMPILE_OPTIONS
.sp
List of options to pass to the compiler.
.sp
This property holds a ;\-list of options
specified so far for its target.  Use the \fBtarget_compile_options()\fP

is appended to the target file name built on disk.  For non\-executable
targets, this property is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX if it is set when a target is created.  This
property is ignored on the Mac for Frameworks and App Bundles.
.SS CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR
.sp
Use the given emulator to run executables created when crosscompiling.  This
command will be added as a prefix to \fBadd_test()\fP test commands for
built target system executables.
.SS CXX_EXTENSIONS
.sp
Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.
.sp
This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be
used.  For some compilers, this results in adding a flag such
as \fB\-std=gnu++11\fP instead of \fB\-std=c++11\fP to the compile line.  This
property is \fBON\fP by default.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \fBCMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS\fP variable if it is set when a target
is created.
.SS CXX_STANDARD
.sp
The C++ standard whose features are requested to build this target.
.sp
This property specifies the C++ standard whose features are requested
to build this target.  For some compilers, this results in adding a
flag such as \fB\-std=gnu++11\fP to the compile line.  For compilers that
have no notion of a standard level, such as MSVC, this has no effect.
.sp
Supported values are \fB98\fP, \fB11\fP and \fB14\fP\&.
.sp
If the value requested does not result in a compile flag being added for
the compiler in use, a previous standard flag will be added instead.  This
means that using:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 11)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
with a compiler which does not support \fB\-std=gnu++11\fP or an equivalent
flag will not result in an error or warning, but will instead add the
\fB\-std=gnu++98\fP flag if supported.  This "decay" behavior may be controlled
with the \fBCXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED\fP target property.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \fBCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD\fP variable if it is set when a target
is created.
.SS CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED
.sp
Boolean describing whether the value of \fBCXX_STANDARD\fP is a requirement.
.sp
If this property is set to \fBON\fP, then the value of the
\fBCXX_STANDARD\fP target property is treated as a requirement.  If this
property is \fBOFF\fP or unset, the \fBCXX_STANDARD\fP target property is
treated as optional and may "decay" to a previous standard if the requested is
not available.  For compilers that have no notion of a standard level, such as
MSVC, this has no effect.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \fBCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED\fP variable if it is set when a
target is created.
.SS DEBUG_POSTFIX
.sp
See target property <CONFIG>_POSTFIX.
.sp
This property is a special case of the more\-general <CONFIG>_POSTFIX
property for the DEBUG configuration.
.SS DEFINE_SYMBOL
.sp
Define a symbol when compiling this target\(aqs sources.
.sp
DEFINE_SYMBOL sets the name of the preprocessor symbol defined when
compiling sources in a shared library.  If not set here then it is set
to target_EXPORTS by default (with some substitutions if the target is
not a valid C identifier).  This is useful for headers to know whether
they are being included from inside their library or outside to
properly setup dllexport/dllimport decorations.
.SS EchoString
.sp
A message to be displayed when the target is built.
.sp
A message to display on some generators (such as makefiles) when the
target is built.
.SS ENABLE_EXPORTS
.sp
Specify whether an executable exports symbols for loadable modules.
.sp
Normally an executable does not export any symbols because it is the
final program.  It is possible for an executable to export symbols to
be used by loadable modules.  When this property is set to true CMake
will allow other targets to "link" to the executable with the
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES command.  On all platforms a target\-level
dependency on the executable is created for targets that link to it.
For DLL platforms an import library will be created for the exported
symbols and then used for linking.  All Windows\-based systems
including Cygwin are DLL platforms.  For non\-DLL platforms that
require all symbols to be resolved at link time, such as Mac OS X, the
module will "link" to the executable using a flag like
"\-bundle_loader".  For other non\-DLL platforms the link rule is simply
ignored since the dynamic loader will automatically bind symbols when
the module is loaded.
.SS EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
.sp
Exclude the target from the all target.
.sp
A property on a target that indicates if the target is excluded from
the default build target.  If it is not, then with a Makefile for
example typing make will cause this target to be built.  The same
concept applies to the default build of other generators.  Installing
a target with EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true has undefined behavior.
.SS EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration version of target exclusion from "Build Solution".
.sp
This is the configuration\-specific version of
EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD.  If the generic EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD
is also set on a target, EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_<CONFIG> takes
precedence in configurations for which it has a value.
.SS EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD
.sp
Exclude target from "Build Solution".
.sp
This property is only used by Visual Studio generators 7 and above.
When set to TRUE, the target will not be built when you press "Build
Solution".
.SS EXPORT_NAME
.sp
Exported name for target files.
.sp
This sets the name for the IMPORTED target generated when it this
target is is exported.  If not set, the logical target name is used by
default.
.SS FOLDER
.sp
Set the folder name. Use to organize targets in an IDE.
.sp
Targets with no FOLDER property will appear as top level entities in
IDEs like Visual Studio.  Targets with the same FOLDER property value
will appear next to each other in a folder of that name.  To nest
folders, use FOLDER values such as \(aqGUI/Dialogs\(aq with \(aq/\(aq characters
separating folder levels.
.SS Fortran_FORMAT
.sp
Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the Fortran source layout.
.sp
This property tells CMake whether the Fortran source files in a target
use fixed\-format or free\-format.  CMake will pass the corresponding
format flag to the compiler.  Use the source\-specific Fortran_FORMAT
property to change the format of a specific source file.  If the
variable CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.
.SS Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
.sp
Specify output directory for Fortran modules provided by the target.
.sp
If the target contains Fortran source files that provide modules and
the compiler supports a module output directory this specifies the
directory in which the modules will be placed.  When this property is
not set the modules will be placed in the build directory
corresponding to the target\(aqs source directory.  If the variable
CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.
.sp
Note that some compilers will automatically search the module output
directory for modules USEd during compilation but others will not.  If
your sources USE modules their location must be specified by
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES regardless of this property.
.SS FRAMEWORK
.sp
This target is a framework on the Mac.
.sp
If a shared library target has this property set to true it will be
built as a framework when built on the mac.  It will have the
directory structure required for a framework and will be suitable to
be used with the \-framework option
.SS GENERATOR_FILE_NAME
.sp
Generator\(aqs file for this target.
.sp
An internal property used by some generators to record the name of the
project or dsp file associated with this target.  Note that at
configure time, this property is only set for targets created by
include_external_msproject().
.SS GNUtoMS
.sp
Convert GNU import library (.dll.a) to MS format (.lib).
.sp
When linking a shared library or executable that exports symbols using
GNU tools on Windows (MinGW/MSYS) with Visual Studio installed convert
the import library (.dll.a) from GNU to MS format (.lib).  Both import
libraries will be installed by install(TARGETS) and exported by
install(EXPORT) and export() to be linked by applications with either
GNU\- or MS\-compatible tools.
.sp
If the variable CMAKE_GNUtoMS is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.  The variable must be set
prior to the first command that enables a language such as project()
or enable_language().  CMake provides the variable as an option to the
user automatically when configuring on Windows with GNU tools.
.SS HAS_CXX
.sp
Link the target using the C++ linker tool (obsolete).
.sp
This is equivalent to setting the LINKER_LANGUAGE property to CXX.
See that property\(aqs documentation for details.
.SS IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM
.sp
Specify #include line transforms for dependencies in a target.
.sp
This property specifies rules to transform macro\-like #include lines
during implicit dependency scanning of C and C++ source files.  The
list of rules must be semicolon\-separated with each entry of the form
"A_MACRO(%)=value\-with\-%" (the % must be literal).  During dependency
scanning occurrences of A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be
replaced by the value given with the macro argument substituted for
\(aq%\(aq.  For example, the entry
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
MYDIR(%)=<mydir/%>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will convert lines of the form
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#include MYDIR(myheader.h)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#include <mydir/myheader.h>
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
allowing the dependency to be followed.
.sp
This property applies to sources in the target on which it is set.
.SS IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS
.sp
Configurations provided for an IMPORTED target.
.sp
Set this to the list of configuration names available for an IMPORTED
target.  The names correspond to configurations defined in the project
from which the target is imported.  If the importing project uses a
different set of configurations the names may be mapped using the
MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG> property.  Ignored for non\-imported
targets.
.SS IMPORTED_IMPLIB_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of IMPORTED_IMPLIB property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS IMPORTED_IMPLIB
.sp
Full path to the import library for an IMPORTED target.
.sp
Set this to the location of the ".lib" part of a windows DLL.  Ignored
for non\-imported targets.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES
.sp
Dependent shared libraries of an imported shared library.
.sp
Shared libraries may be linked to other shared libraries as part of
their implementation.  On some platforms the linker searches for the
dependent libraries of shared libraries they are including in the
link.  Set this property to the list of dependent shared libraries of
an imported library.  The list should be disjoint from the list of
interface libraries in the INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property.  On
platforms requiring dependent shared libraries to be found at link
time CMake uses this list to add appropriate files or paths to the
link command line.  Ignored for non\-imported targets.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES
.sp
Languages compiled into an IMPORTED static library.
.sp
Set this to the list of languages of source files compiled to produce
a STATIC IMPORTED library (such as "C" or "CXX").  CMake accounts for
these languages when computing how to link a target to the imported
library.  For example, when a C executable links to an imported C++
static library CMake chooses the C++ linker to satisfy language
runtime dependencies of the static library.
.sp
This property is ignored for targets that are not STATIC libraries.
This property is ignored for non\-imported targets.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.
.sp
This property is ignored if the target also has a non\-empty
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property.
.sp
This property is deprecated.  Use INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES instead.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
.sp
Transitive link interface of an IMPORTED target.
.sp
Set this to the list of libraries whose interface is included when an
IMPORTED library target is linked to another target.  The libraries
will be included on the link line for the target.  Unlike the
LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property, this property applies to all
imported target types, including STATIC libraries.  This property is
ignored for non\-imported targets.
.sp
This property is ignored if the target also has a non\-empty
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property.
.sp
This property is deprecated.  Use INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES instead.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY.
.sp
If set, this property completely overrides the generic property for
the named configuration.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
.sp
Repetition count for cycles of IMPORTED static libraries.
.sp
This is LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY for IMPORTED targets.
.SS IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of IMPORTED_LOCATION property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS IMPORTED_LOCATION
.sp
Full path to the main file on disk for an IMPORTED target.
.sp
Set this to the location of an IMPORTED target file on disk.  For
executables this is the location of the executable file.  For bundles
on OS X this is the location of the executable file inside
Contents/MacOS under the application bundle folder.  For static
libraries and modules this is the location of the library or module.
For shared libraries on non\-DLL platforms this is the location of the
shared library.  For frameworks on OS X this is the location of the
library file symlink just inside the framework folder.  For DLLs this
is the location of the ".dll" part of the library.  For UNKNOWN
libraries this is the location of the file to be linked.  Ignored for
non\-imported targets.
.sp
Projects may skip IMPORTED_LOCATION if the configuration\-specific
property IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG> is set.  To get the location of an
imported target read one of the LOCATION or LOCATION_<CONFIG>
properties.
.SS IMPORTED_NO_SONAME_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of IMPORTED_NO_SONAME property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS IMPORTED_NO_SONAME
.sp
Specifies that an IMPORTED shared library target has no "soname".
.sp
Set this property to true for an imported shared library file that has
no "soname" field.  CMake may adjust generated link commands for some
platforms to prevent the linker from using the path to the library in
place of its missing soname.  Ignored for non\-imported targets.
.SS IMPORTED
.sp
Read\-only indication of whether a target is IMPORTED.
.sp
The boolean value of this property is \fBTrue\fP for targets created with
the IMPORTED option to \fBadd_executable()\fP or \fBadd_library()\fP\&.
It is \fBFalse\fP for targets built within the project.
.SS IMPORTED_SONAME_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of IMPORTED_SONAME property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS IMPORTED_SONAME
.sp
The "soname" of an IMPORTED target of shared library type.
.sp
Set this to the "soname" embedded in an imported shared library.  This
is meaningful only on platforms supporting the feature.  Ignored for
non\-imported targets.
.SS IMPORT_PREFIX
.sp
What comes before the import library name.
.sp
Similar to the target property PREFIX, but used for import libraries
(typically corresponding to a DLL) instead of regular libraries.  A
target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as "lib")
on an import library name.
.SS IMPORT_SUFFIX
.sp
What comes after the import library name.
.sp
Similar to the target property SUFFIX, but used for import libraries
(typically corresponding to a DLL) instead of regular libraries.  A
target property that can be set to override the suffix (such as
".lib") on an import library name.
.SS INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
.sp
List of preprocessor include file search directories.
.sp
This property specifies the list of directories given so far to the
\fBtarget_include_directories()\fP command.  In addition to accepting
values from that command, values may be set directly on any
target using the \fBset_property()\fP command.  A target gets its
initial value for this property from the value of the
\fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP directory property.  Both directory and
target property values are adjusted by calls to the
\fBinclude_directories()\fP command.
.sp
The value of this property is used by the generators to set the include
paths for the compiler.
.sp
Relative paths should not be added to this property directly. Use one of
the commands above instead to handle relative paths.
.sp
Contents of \fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP
manual for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS INSTALL_NAME_DIR
.sp
Mac OSX directory name for installed targets.
.sp
INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a string specifying the directory portion of the
"install_name" field of shared libraries on Mac OSX to use in the
installed targets.
.SS INSTALL_RPATH
.sp
The rpath to use for installed targets.
.sp
A semicolon\-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed
targets (for platforms that support it).  This property is initialized
by the value of the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH if it is set when a
target is created.
.SS INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH
.sp
Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.
.sp
INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true will
append directories in the linker search path and outside the project
to the INSTALL_RPATH.  This property is initialized by the value of
the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH if it is set when a
target is created.
.SS INTERFACE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS
.sp
List of interface options to pass to uic.
.sp
Targets may populate this property to publish the options
required to use when invoking \fBuic\fP\&.  Consuming targets can add entries to their
own \fBAUTOUIC_OPTIONS\fP property such as
\fB$<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,INTERFACE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS>\fP to use the uic options
specified in the interface of \fBfoo\fP\&. This is done automatically by
the \fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP command.
.sp
This property supports generator expressions.  See the
\fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP manual for available expressions.
.SS INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
.sp
List of public compile definitions requirements for a library.
.sp
Targets may populate this property to publish the compile definitions
required to compile against the headers for the target.  The \fBtarget_compile_definitions()\fP
command populates this property with values given to the \fBPUBLIC\fP and
\fBINTERFACE\fP keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.
.sp
When target dependencies are specified using \fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP,
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to determine the
build properties of the consumer.
.sp
Contents of \fBINTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP
manual for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP
\-manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS INTERFACE_COMPILE_FEATURES
.sp
List of public compile features requirements for a library.
.sp
Targets may populate this property to publish the compile features
required to compile against the headers for the target.  The \fBtarget_compile_features()\fP
command populates this property with values given to the \fBPUBLIC\fP and
\fBINTERFACE\fP keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.
.sp
When target dependencies are specified using \fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP,
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to determine the
build properties of the consumer.
.sp
Contents of \fBINTERFACE_COMPILE_FEATURES\fP may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP
manual for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP
\-manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP manual for information on compile
features and a list of supported compilers.
.SS INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS
.sp
List of public compile options requirements for a library.
.sp
Targets may populate this property to publish the compile options
required to compile against the headers for the target.  The \fBtarget_compile_options()\fP
command populates this property with values given to the \fBPUBLIC\fP and
\fBINTERFACE\fP keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.
.sp
When target dependencies are specified using \fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP,
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to determine the
build properties of the consumer.
.sp
Contents of \fBINTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS\fP may use "generator expressions"

\-manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
.sp
List of public include directories requirements for a library.
.sp
Targets may populate this property to publish the include directories
required to compile against the headers for the target.  The \fBtarget_include_directories()\fP
command populates this property with values given to the \fBPUBLIC\fP and
\fBINTERFACE\fP keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.
.sp
When target dependencies are specified using \fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP,
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to determine the

Contents of \fBINTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP
manual for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP
\-manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.sp
Include directories usage requirements commonly differ between the build\-tree
and the install\-tree.  The \fBBUILD_INTERFACE\fP and \fBINSTALL_INTERFACE\fP
generator expressions can be used to describe separate usage requirements
based on the usage location.  Relative paths are allowed within the
\fBINSTALL_INTERFACE\fP expression and are interpreted relative to the
installation prefix.  For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
target_include_directories(mylib INTERFACE

.SS Creating Relocatable Packages
.sp
Note that it is not advisable to populate the \fBINSTALL_INTERFACE\fP of the
\fBINTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP of a target with absolute paths to the include
directories of dependencies.  That would hard\-code into installed packages
the include directory paths for dependencies
\fBas found on the machine the package was made on\fP\&.
.sp
The \fBINSTALL_INTERFACE\fP of the \fBINTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP is only
suitable for specifying the required include directories for headers
provided with the target itself, not those provided by the transitive
dependencies listed in its \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP target
property.  Those dependencies should themselves be targets that specify
their own header locations in \fBINTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP\&.
.sp
See the Creating Relocatable Packages section of the
\fBcmake\-packages(7)\fP manual for discussion of additional care
that must be taken when specifying usage requirements while creating
packages for redistribution.
.SS INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES
.sp
List public interface libraries for a library.
.sp
This property contains the list of transitive link dependencies.  When
the target is linked into another target using the
\fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP command, the libraries listed (and
recursively their link interface libraries) will be provided to the
other target also.  This property is overridden by the
\fBLINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES\fP or
\fBLINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>\fP property if policy
\fBCMP0022\fP is \fBOLD\fP or unset.
.sp
Contents of \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP
manual for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS Creating Relocatable Packages
.sp
Note that it is not advisable to populate the
\fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP of a target with absolute paths to dependencies.
That would hard\-code into installed packages the library file paths
for dependencies \fBas found on the machine the package was made on\fP\&.
.sp
See the Creating Relocatable Packages section of the
\fBcmake\-packages(7)\fP manual for discussion of additional care
that must be taken when specifying usage requirements while creating
packages for redistribution.
.SS INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
.sp
Whether consumers need to create a position\-independent target
.sp
The \fBINTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP property informs consumers of
this target whether they must set their
\fBPOSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP property to \fBON\fP\&.  If this
property is set to \fBON\fP, then the \fBPOSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP
property on  all consumers will be set to \fBON\fP\&. Similarly, if this
property is set to \fBOFF\fP, then the \fBPOSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP
property on all consumers will be set to \fBOFF\fP\&.  If this property is
undefined, then consumers will determine their
\fBPOSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP property by other means.  Consumers
must ensure that the targets that they link to have a consistent
requirement for their \fBINTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP property.
.SS INTERFACE_SOURCES
.sp
List of interface sources to compile into consuming targets.
.sp
Targets may populate this property to publish the sources
for consuming targets to compile.  The \fBtarget_sources()\fP command
populates this property with values given to the \fBPUBLIC\fP and
\fBINTERFACE\fP keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.
.sp
When target dependencies are specified using \fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP,
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to determine the
sources of the consumer.
.sp
Contents of \fBINTERFACE_SOURCES\fP may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP
manual for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
.sp
List of public system include directories for a library.
.sp
Targets may populate this property to publish the include directories
which contain system headers, and therefore should not result in
compiler warnings.  The \fBtarget_include_directories(SYSTEM)\fP
command signature populates this property with values given to the
\fBPUBLIC\fP and \fBINTERFACE\fP keywords.
.sp
Projects may also get and set the property directly, but must be aware that
adding directories to this property does not make those directories used
during compilation.  Adding directories to this property marks directories
as \fBSYSTEM\fP which otherwise would be used in a non\-\fBSYSTEM\fP manner.  This
can appear similar to \(aqduplication\(aq, so prefer the
high\-level \fBtarget_include_directories(SYSTEM)\fP command and avoid
setting the property by low\-level means.
.sp
When target dependencies are specified using \fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP,
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to mark the
same include directories as containing system headers.
.sp
Contents of \fBINTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP may use "generator
expressions" with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the
\fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP manual for available expressions.
See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP manual for more on defining
buildsystem properties.
.SS INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration interprocedural optimization for a target.
.sp
This is a per\-configuration version of INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION.
If set, this property overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.
.SS INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
.sp
Enable interprocedural optimization for a target.
.sp
If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are
known to be supported by the compiler.
.SS JOB_POOL_COMPILE
.sp
Ninja only: Pool used for compiling.
.sp
The number of parallel compile processes could be limited by defining
pools with the global \fBJOB_POOLS\fP
property and then specifying here the pool name.
.sp
For instance:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

\fBCMAKE_JOB_POOL_COMPILE\fP\&.
.SS JOB_POOL_LINK
.sp
Ninja only: Pool used for linking.
.sp
The number of parallel link processes could be limited by defining
pools with the global \fBJOB_POOLS\fP
property and then specifing here the pool name.
.sp
For instance:
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
This property is initialized by the value of \fBCMAKE_JOB_POOL_LINK\fP\&.
.SS LABELS
.sp
Specify a list of text labels associated with a target.
.sp
Target label semantics are currently unspecified.
.SS <LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE
.sp
This property is implemented only when \fB<LANG>\fP is \fBC\fP or \fBCXX\fP\&.
.sp
Specify a ;\-list containing a command
line for the \fBinclude\-what\-you\-use\fP tool.  The Makefile Generators
and the \fBNinja\fP generator will run this tool along with the
compiler and report a warning if the tool reports any problems.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \fBCMAKE_<LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE\fP variable if it is set
when a target is created.
.SS <LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET
.sp
Value for symbol visibility compile flags
.sp
The \fB<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET\fP property determines the value passed in a
visibility related compile option, such as \fB\-fvisibility=\fP for \fB<LANG>\fP\&.
This property affects compilation in sources of all types of targets
(subject to policy \fBCMP0063\fP).
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET\fP variable if it is set when a
target is created.
.SS LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration output directory for
LIBRARY target files.
.sp
This is a per\-configuration version of the
\fBLIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\fP target property, but
multi\-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) do NOT append a
per\-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This
property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>\fP variable if
it is set when a target is created.
.SS LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
.sp
Output directory in which to build LIBRARY target files.
.sp
This property specifies the directory into which library target files
should be built.  Multi\-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) append a
per\-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is created.
.sp
See also the \fBLIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>\fP target property.
.SS LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration output name for
LIBRARY target files.
.sp
This is the configuration\-specific version of the
\fBLIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME\fP target property.
.SS LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME
.sp
Output name for LIBRARY target files.
.sp
This property specifies the base name for library target files.  It
overrides \fBOUTPUT_NAME\fP and \fBOUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>\fP
properties.
.sp
See also the \fBLIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>\fP target property.
.SS LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED
.sp
Do not depend on linked shared library files.
.sp
Set this property to true to tell CMake generators not to add
file\-level dependencies on the shared library files linked by this
target.  Modification to the shared libraries will not be sufficient
to re\-link this target.  Logical target\-level dependencies will not be
affected so the linked shared libraries will still be brought up to
date before this target is built.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED if it is set when a target is created.
.SS LINK_DEPENDS
.sp
Additional files on which a target binary depends for linking.
.sp
Specifies a semicolon\-separated list of full\-paths to files on which
the link rule for this target depends.  The target binary will be
linked if any of the named files is newer than it.
.sp
This property is ignored by non\-Makefile generators.  It is intended
to specify dependencies on "linker scripts" for custom Makefile link
rules.
.SS LINKER_LANGUAGE
.sp
Specifies language whose compiler will invoke the linker.
.sp
For executables, shared libraries, and modules, this sets the language
whose compiler is used to link the target (such as "C" or "CXX").  A
typical value for an executable is the language of the source file
providing the program entry point (main).  If not set, the language
with the highest linker preference value is the default.  See
documentation of CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE variables.
.sp
If this property is not set by the user, it will be calculated at
generate\-time by CMake.
.SS LINK_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration linker flags for a target.
.sp
This is the configuration\-specific version of LINK_FLAGS.
.SS LINK_FLAGS
.sp
Additional flags to use when linking this target.
.sp
The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags to the link
step of a target.  LINK_FLAGS_<CONFIG> will add to the configuration
<CONFIG>, for example, DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDEBINFO.
.SS LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration list of public interface libraries for a target.
.sp
This is the configuration\-specific version of
\fBLINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES\fP\&.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.
.sp
This property is overridden by the \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP
property if policy \fBCMP0022\fP is \fBNEW\fP\&.
.sp
This property is deprecated.  Use \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP
instead.
.SS Creating Relocatable Packages
.sp
Note that it is not advisable to populate the
\fBLINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>\fP of a target with absolute paths to dependencies.
That would hard\-code into installed packages the library file paths
for dependencies \fBas found on the machine the package was made on\fP\&.
.sp
See the Creating Relocatable Packages section of the
\fBcmake\-packages(7)\fP manual for discussion of additional care
that must be taken when specifying usage requirements while creating
packages for redistribution.
.SS LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
.sp
List public interface libraries for a shared library or executable.
.sp
By default linking to a shared library target transitively links to
targets with which the library itself was linked.  For an executable
with exports (see the \fBENABLE_EXPORTS\fP target property) no
default transitive link dependencies are used.  This property replaces the default
transitive link dependencies with an explicit list.  When the target
is linked into another target using the \fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP
command, the libraries listed (and recursively
their link interface libraries) will be provided to the other target
also.  If the list is empty then no transitive link dependencies will
be incorporated when this target is linked into another target even if
the default set is non\-empty.  This property is initialized by the
value of the \fBCMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES\fP variable if it is
set when a target is created.  This property is ignored for \fBSTATIC\fP
libraries.
.sp
This property is overridden by the \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP
property if policy \fBCMP0022\fP is \fBNEW\fP\&.
.sp
This property is deprecated.  Use \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP
instead.
.SS Creating Relocatable Packages
.sp
Note that it is not advisable to populate the
\fBLINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES\fP of a target with absolute paths to dependencies.
That would hard\-code into installed packages the library file paths
for dependencies \fBas found on the machine the package was made on\fP\&.
.sp
See the Creating Relocatable Packages section of the
\fBcmake\-packages(7)\fP manual for discussion of additional care
that must be taken when specifying usage requirements while creating
packages for redistribution.
.SS LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration repetition count for cycles of STATIC libraries.
.sp
This is the configuration\-specific version of
LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.
.SS LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
.sp
Repetition count for STATIC libraries with cyclic dependencies.
.sp
When linking to a STATIC library target with cyclic dependencies the
linker may need to scan more than once through the archives in the
strongly connected component of the dependency graph.  CMake by
default constructs the link line so that the linker will scan through
the component at least twice.  This property specifies the minimum
number of scans if it is larger than the default.  CMake uses the
largest value specified by any target in a component.
.SS LINK_LIBRARIES
.sp
List of direct link dependencies.
.sp
This property specifies the list of libraries or targets which will be
used for linking.  In addition to accepting values from the
\fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP command, values may be set directly on
any target using the \fBset_property()\fP command.
.sp
The value of this property is used by the generators to set the link
libraries for the compiler.
.sp
Contents of \fBLINK_LIBRARIES\fP may use "generator expressions" with the
syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP manual
for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC
.sp
End a link line such that static system libraries are used.
.sp
Some linkers support switches such as \-Bstatic and \-Bdynamic to
determine whether to use static or shared libraries for \-lXXX options.
CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link
directories for the platform.  By default CMake adds an option at the
end of the library list (if necessary) to set the linker search type
back to its starting type.  This property switches the final linker
search type to \-Bstatic regardless of how it started.  See also
LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC.
.SS LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC
.sp
Assume the linker looks for static libraries by default.
.sp
Some linkers support switches such as \-Bstatic and \-Bdynamic to
determine whether to use static or shared libraries for \-lXXX options.
CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link
directories for the platform.  By default the linker search type is
assumed to be \-Bdynamic at the beginning of the library list.  This
property switches the assumption to \-Bstatic.  It is intended for use
when linking an executable statically (e.g.  with the GNU \-static
option).  See also LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC.
.SS LOCATION_<CONFIG>
.sp
Read\-only property providing a target location on disk.
.sp
A read\-only property that indicates where a target\(aqs main file is
located on disk for the configuration <CONFIG>.  The property is
defined only for library and executable targets.  An imported target
may provide a set of configurations different from that of the
importing project.  By default CMake looks for an exact\-match but
otherwise uses an arbitrary available configuration.  Use the
MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG> property to map imported configurations
explicitly.
.sp
Do not set properties that affect the location of a target after
reading this property.  These include properties whose names match
"(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_<CONFIG>)?",
\fB(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)\fP, or "LINKER_LANGUAGE".  Failure to follow
this rule is not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target
undefined.
.SS LOCATION
.sp
Read\-only location of a target on disk.
.sp
For an imported target, this read\-only property returns the value of
the LOCATION_<CONFIG> property for an unspecified configuration
<CONFIG> provided by the target.
.sp
For a non\-imported target, this property is provided for compatibility
with CMake 2.4 and below.  It was meant to get the location of an
executable target\(aqs output file for use in add_custom_command.  The
path may contain a build\-system\-specific portion that is replaced at
build time with the configuration getting built (such as
"$(ConfigurationName)" in VS).  In CMake 2.6 and above
add_custom_command automatically recognizes a target name in its
COMMAND and DEPENDS options and computes the target location.  In
CMake 2.8.4 and above add_custom_command recognizes generator
expressions to refer to target locations anywhere in the command.
Therefore this property is not needed for creating custom commands.
.sp
Do not set properties that affect the location of a target after
reading this property.  These include properties whose names match
"(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_<CONFIG>)?",
\fB(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)\fP, or "LINKER_LANGUAGE".  Failure to follow
this rule is not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target
undefined.
.SS MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST
.sp
Specify a custom Info.plist template for a Mac OS X App Bundle.
.sp
An executable target with MACOSX_BUNDLE enabled will be built as an
application bundle on Mac OS X.  By default its Info.plist file is
created by configuring a template called MacOSXBundleInfo.plist.in
located in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.  This property specifies an
alternative template file name which may be a full path.
.sp
The following target properties may be set to specify content to be
configured into the file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_STRING
MACOSX_BUNDLE_ICON_FILE
MACOSX_BUNDLE_GUI_IDENTIFIER
MACOSX_BUNDLE_LONG_VERSION_STRING

MACOSX_BUNDLE_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_VERSION
MACOSX_BUNDLE_COPYRIGHT
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all targets in a
directory that do not have each specific property set.  If a custom
Info.plist is specified by this property it may of course hard\-code
all the settings instead of using the target properties.
.SS MACOSX_BUNDLE
.sp
Build an executable as an application bundle on Mac OS X.
.sp
When this property is set to true the executable when built on Mac OS
X will be created as an application bundle.  This makes it a GUI
executable that can be launched from the Finder.  See the
MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST target property for information about
creation of the Info.plist file for the application bundle.  This
property is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE if it is set when a target is created.
.SS MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST
.sp
Specify a custom Info.plist template for a Mac OS X Framework.
.sp
A library target with FRAMEWORK enabled will be built as a framework
on Mac OS X.  By default its Info.plist file is created by configuring
a template called MacOSXFrameworkInfo.plist.in located in the
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.  This property specifies an alternative template
file name which may be a full path.
.sp
The following target properties may be set to specify content to be
configured into the file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_ICON_FILE
MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER
MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_BUNDLE_VERSION
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all targets in a
directory that do not have each specific property set.  If a custom
Info.plist is specified by this property it may of course hard\-code
all the settings instead of using the target properties.
.SS MACOSX_RPATH
.sp
Whether to use rpaths on Mac OS X.
.sp
When this property is set to true, the directory portion of
the "install_name" field of shared libraries will be \fB@rpath\fP
unless overridden by \fBINSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP\&.  Runtime
paths will also be embedded in binaries using this target and
can be controlled by the \fBINSTALL_RPATH\fP target property.
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\fBCMAKE_MACOSX_RPATH\fP if it is set when a target is
created.
.sp
Policy CMP0042 was introduced to change the default value of
MACOSX_RPATH to ON.  This is because use of \fB@rpath\fP is a
more flexible and powerful alternative to \fB@executable_path\fP and
\fB@loader_path\fP\&.
.SS MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>
.sp
Map from project configuration to IMPORTED target\(aqs configuration.
.sp
Set this to the list of configurations of an imported target that may
be used for the current project\(aqs <CONFIG> configuration.  Targets
imported from another project may not provide the same set of
configuration names available in the current project.  Setting this
property tells CMake what imported configurations are suitable for use
when building the <CONFIG> configuration.  The first configuration in
the list found to be provided by the imported target is selected.  If
this property is set and no matching configurations are available,
then the imported target is considered to be not found.  This property
is ignored for non\-imported targets.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG> if it is set when a target is
created.
.SS NAME
.sp
Logical name for the target.
.sp
Read\-only logical name for the target as used by CMake.
.SS NO_SONAME
.sp
Whether to set "soname" when linking a shared library or module.
.sp
Enable this boolean property if a generated shared library or module
should not have "soname" set.  Default is to set "soname" on all
shared libraries and modules as long as the platform supports it.
Generally, use this property only for leaf private libraries or
plugins.  If you use it on normal shared libraries which other targets
link against, on some platforms a linker will insert a full path to
the library (as specified at link time) into the dynamic section of
the dependent binary.  Therefore, once installed, dynamic loader may
eventually fail to locate the library for the binary.
.SS NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED
.sp
Do not treat includes from IMPORTED target interfaces as SYSTEM.
.sp
The contents of the INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES of IMPORTED targets
are treated as SYSTEM includes by default.  If this property is
enabled, the contents of the INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES of IMPORTED
targets are not treated as system includes.  This property is
initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED
if it is set when a target is created.
.SS OSX_ARCHITECTURES_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration OS X binary architectures for a target.
.sp
This property is the configuration\-specific version of
\fBOSX_ARCHITECTURES\fP\&.
.SS OSX_ARCHITECTURES
.sp
Target specific architectures for OS X.
.sp
The \fBOSX_ARCHITECTURES\fP property sets the target binary architecture for
targets on OS X (\fB\-arch\fP).  This property is initialized by the value of the
variable \fBCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES\fP if it is set when a target is
created.  Use \fBOSX_ARCHITECTURES_<CONFIG>\fP to set the binary
architectures on a per\-configuration basis, where \fB<CONFIG>\fP is an
upper\-case name (e.g. \fBOSX_ARCHITECTURES_DEBUG\fP).
.SS OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration target file base name.
.sp
This is the configuration\-specific version of OUTPUT_NAME.
.SS OUTPUT_NAME
.sp
Output name for target files.
.sp
This sets the base name for output files created for an executable or
library target.  If not set, the logical target name is used by
default.
.SS PDB_NAME_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration output name for the MS debug symbol \fB\&.pdb\fP file
generated by the linker for an executable or shared library target.
.sp
This is the configuration\-specific version of \fBPDB_NAME\fP\&.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This property does not apply to STATIC library targets because no linker
is invoked to produce them so they have no linker\-generated \fB\&.pdb\fP file
containing debug symbols.
.sp
The linker\-generated program database files are specified by the
\fB/pdb\fP linker flag and are not the same as compiler\-generated
program database files specified by the \fB/Fd\fP compiler flag.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
.sp
Whether to create a position\-independent target
.sp
The \fBPOSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP property determines whether position
independent executables or shared libraries will be created.  This
property is \fBTrue\fP by default for \fBSHARED\fP and \fBMODULE\fP library
targets and \fBFalse\fP otherwise.  This property is initialized by the value
of the \fBCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP variable  if it is set
when a target is created.
.SS PREFIX

.sp
A target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as
"lib") on a library name.
.SS PRIVATE_HEADER
.sp
Specify private header files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.
.sp
Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate
frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms.

See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global and directory property for a target.
.SS RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration output directory for
RUNTIME target files.
.sp
This is a per\-configuration version of the
\fBRUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\fP target property, but
multi\-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) do NOT append a
per\-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This
property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>\fP variable if
it is set when a target is created.
.SS RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY

SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip automatic
generation of an rpath allowing the target to run from the build tree.
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH if it is set when a target is created.
.SS SOURCES
.sp
Source names specified for a target.
.sp
List of sources specified for a target.
.SS SOVERSION
.sp
What version number is this target.
.sp
For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to specify the
build version and API version respectively.  When building or
installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports
symlinks and the linker supports so\-names.  If only one of both is
specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number.
SOVERSION is ignored if NO_SONAME property is set.  For shared
libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION attribute is parsed
to extract a "major.minor" version number.  These numbers are used as
the image version of the binary.
.SS STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration flags for creating a static library.
.sp
This is the configuration\-specific version of STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS.
.SS STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS

".so" or ".exe") on the name of a library, module or executable.
.SS TYPE
.sp
The type of the target.
.sp
This read\-only property can be used to test the type of the given
target.  It will be one of STATIC_LIBRARY, MODULE_LIBRARY,
SHARED_LIBRARY, INTERFACE_LIBRARY, EXECUTABLE or one of the internal
target types.
.SS VERSION
.sp
What version number is this target.
.sp
For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to specify the
build version and API version respectively.  When building or
installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports
symlinks and the linker supports so\-names.  If only one of both is
specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number.  For
executables VERSION can be used to specify the build version.  When
building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the
platform supports symlinks.  For shared libraries and executables on
Windows the VERSION attribute is parsed to extract a "major.minor"
version number.  These numbers are used as the image version of the
binary.
.SS VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN
.sp
Whether to add a compile flag to hide symbols of inline functions
.sp
The \fBVISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN\fP property determines whether a flag for
hiding symbols for inline functions, such as \fB\-fvisibility\-inlines\-hidden\fP,
should be used when invoking the compiler.  This property affects compilation
in sources of all types of targets (subject to policy \fBCMP0063\fP).

Adds one or more semicolon\-delimited WinRT references to a generated
Visual Studio project.  For example, "Windows;Windows.UI.Core".
.SS WIN32_EXECUTABLE
.sp
Build an executable with a WinMain entry point on windows.
.sp
When this property is set to true the executable when linked on
Windows will be created with a WinMain() entry point instead of just
main().  This makes it a GUI executable instead of a console
application.  See the CMAKE_MFC_FLAG variable documentation to
configure use of MFC for WinMain executables.  This property is
initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_WIN32_EXECUTABLE if it
is set when a target is created.
.SS XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an\-attribute>
.sp
Set Xcode target attributes directly.
.sp
Tell the Xcode generator to set \(aq<an\-attribute>\(aq to a given value in
the generated Xcode project.  Ignored on other generators.
.sp
See the \fBCMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an\-attribute>\fP variable
to set attributes on all targets in a directory tree.
.sp
Contents of \fBXCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an\-attribute>\fP may use
"generator expressions" with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the
\fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP manual for available
expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS XCTEST
.sp
This target is a XCTest CFBundle on the Mac.
.sp
This property will usually get set via the \fBxctest_add_bundle()\fP
macro in \fBFindXCTest\fP module.
.sp
If a module library target has this property set to true it will be
built as a CFBundle when built on the Mac.  It will have the directory
structure required for a CFBundle.
.sp
This property depends on \fBBUNDLE\fP to be effective.
.SH PROPERTIES ON TESTS
.SS ATTACHED_FILES_ON_FAIL
.sp
Attach a list of files to a dashboard submission if the test fails.
.sp
Same as ATTACHED_FILES, but these files will only be included if the
test does not pass.
.SS ATTACHED_FILES
.sp
Attach a list of files to a dashboard submission.
.sp
Set this property to a list of files that will be encoded and
submitted to the dashboard as an addition to the test result.
.SS COST
.sp
Set this to a floating point value. Tests in a test set will be run in descending order of cost.
.sp
This property describes the cost of a test.  You can explicitly set
this value; tests with higher COST values will run first.
.SS DEPENDS
.sp
Specifies that this test should only be run after the specified list of tests.
.sp
Set this to a list of tests that must finish before this test is run.
.SS ENVIRONMENT
.sp
Specify environment variables that should be defined for running a test.
.sp
If set to a list of environment variables and values of the form
MYVAR=value those environment variables will be defined while running
the test.  The environment is restored to its previous state after the
test is done.
.SS FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
.sp
If the output matches this regular expression the test will fail.
.sp
If set, if the output matches one of specified regular expressions,
the test will fail.  Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set_tests_properties(mytest PROPERTIES
  FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "[^a\-z]Error;ERROR;Failed"
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBFAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION\fP expects a list of regular expressions.
.SS LABELS
.sp
Specify a list of text labels associated with a test.
.sp
The list is reported in dashboard submissions.
.SS MEASUREMENT
.sp
Specify a CDASH measurement and value to be reported for a test.
.sp
If set to a name then that name will be reported to CDASH as a named
measurement with a value of 1.  You may also specify a value by
setting MEASUREMENT to "measurement=value".
.SS PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
.sp
The output must match this regular expression for the test to pass.
.sp
If set, the test output will be checked against the specified regular
expressions and at least one of the regular expressions has to match,
otherwise the test will fail.  Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set_tests_properties(mytest PROPERTIES
  PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "TestPassed;All ok"
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBPASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION\fP expects a list of regular expressions.
.SS PROCESSORS
.sp
How many process slots this test requires
.sp
Denotes the number of processors that this test will require.  This is
typically used for MPI tests, and should be used in conjunction with
the ctest_test PARALLEL_LEVEL option.
.SS REQUIRED_FILES
.sp
List of files required to run the test.
.sp
If set to a list of files, the test will not be run unless all of the
files exist.
.SS RESOURCE_LOCK
.sp
Specify a list of resources that are locked by this test.
.sp
If multiple tests specify the same resource lock, they are guaranteed
not to run concurrently.
.SS RUN_SERIAL
.sp
Do not run this test in parallel with any other test.
.sp
Use this option in conjunction with the ctest_test PARALLEL_LEVEL
option to specify that this test should not be run in parallel with
any other tests.
.SS SKIP_RETURN_CODE
.sp
Return code to mark a test as skipped.
.sp
Sometimes only a test itself can determine if all requirements for the
test are met. If such a situation should not be considered a hard failure
a return code of the process can be specified that will mark the test as
"Not Run" if it is encountered.
.SS TIMEOUT
.sp
How many seconds to allow for this test.
.sp
This property if set will limit a test to not take more than the
specified number of seconds to run.  If it exceeds that the test
process will be killed and ctest will move to the next test.  This
setting takes precedence over \fBCTEST_TEST_TIMEOUT\fP\&.
.SS WILL_FAIL
.sp
If set to true, this will invert the pass/fail flag of the test.
.sp
This property can be used for tests that are expected to fail and
return a non zero return code.
.SS WORKING_DIRECTORY
.sp
The directory from which the test executable will be called.
.sp
If this is not set it is called from the directory the test executable
is located in.
.SH PROPERTIES ON SOURCE FILES
.SS ABSTRACT
.sp
Is this source file an abstract class.
.sp
A property on a source file that indicates if the source file
represents a class that is abstract.  This only makes sense for
languages that have a notion of an abstract class and it is only used
by some tools that wrap classes into other languages.
.SS AUTOUIC_OPTIONS
.sp
Additional options for \fBuic\fP when using \fBAUTOUIC\fP
.sp
This property holds additional command line options
which will be used when \fBuic\fP is executed during the build via \fBAUTOUIC\fP,
i.e. it is equivalent to the optional \fBOPTIONS\fP argument of the
\fBqt4_wrap_ui()\fP macro.
.sp
By default it is empty.
.sp
The options set on the \fB\&.ui\fP source file may override \fBAUTOUIC_OPTIONS\fP set
on the target.
.SS AUTORCC_OPTIONS
.sp
Additional options for \fBrcc\fP when using \fBAUTORCC\fP
.sp
This property holds additional command line options which will be used when
\fBrcc\fP is executed during the build via \fBAUTORCC\fP, i.e. it is equivalent to the
optional \fBOPTIONS\fP argument of the \fBqt4_add_resources()\fP macro.
.sp
By default it is empty.
.sp
The options set on the \fB\&.qrc\fP source file may override \fBAUTORCC_OPTIONS\fP set
on the target.
.SS COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
.sp
Preprocessor definitions for compiling a source file.
.sp
The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a semicolon\-separated
list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax VAR or VAR=value.
Function\-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will
automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system
(note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some
values).  This property may be set on a per\-configuration basis using
the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG> where <CONFIG> is an upper\-case
name (ex.  "COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG").
.sp
CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
by the native build tool.  The VS6 IDE does not support definition
values with spaces (but NMake does).  Xcode does not support
per\-configuration definitions on source files.
.sp
Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
certain values.  CMake has work\-arounds for many cases but some values
may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem
to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work\-around the problem by
adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work\-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead
consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then
report the limitation.  Known limitations include:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
CMake does not reject these values outright because they do work in
some cases.  Use with caution.
.SS COMPILE_FLAGS
.sp
Additional flags to be added when compiling this source file.
.sp
These flags will be added to the list of compile flags when this
source file builds.  Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to pass additional
preprocessor definitions.
.SS EXTERNAL_OBJECT
.sp
If set to true then this is an object file.
.sp
If this property is set to true then the source file is really an
object file and should not be compiled.  It will still be linked into
the target though.
.SS Fortran_FORMAT
.sp
Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the Fortran source layout.
.sp
This property tells CMake whether a given Fortran source file uses
fixed\-format or free\-format.  CMake will pass the corresponding format
flag to the compiler.  Consider using the target\-wide Fortran_FORMAT
property if all source files in a target share the same format.
.SS GENERATED
.sp
Is this source file generated as part of the build process.
.sp
If a source file is generated by the build process CMake will handle
it differently in terms of dependency checking etc.  Otherwise having
a non\-existent source file could create problems.
.SS HEADER_FILE_ONLY
.sp
Is this source file only a header file.
.sp
A property on a source file that indicates if the source file is a
header file with no associated implementation.  This is set
automatically based on the file extension and is used by CMake to
determine if certain dependency information should be computed.
.SS KEEP_EXTENSION
.sp
Make the output file have the same extension as the source file.
.sp
If this property is set then the file extension of the output file
will be the same as that of the source file.  Normally the output file
extension is computed based on the language of the source file, for
example .cxx will go to a .o extension.
.SS LABELS
.sp
Specify a list of text labels associated with a source file.
.sp
This property has meaning only when the source file is listed in a
target whose LABELS property is also set.  No other semantics are
currently specified.
.SS LANGUAGE
.sp
What programming language is the file.
.sp
A property that can be set to indicate what programming language the
source file is.  If it is not set the language is determined based on
the file extension.  Typical values are CXX C etc.  Setting this
property for a file means this file will be compiled.  Do not set this
for headers or files that should not be compiled.
.SS LOCATION
.sp
The full path to a source file.
.sp
A read only property on a SOURCE FILE that contains the full path to
the source file.
.SS MACOSX_PACKAGE_LOCATION
.sp
Place a source file inside a Mac OS X bundle, CFBundle, or framework.
.sp
Executable targets with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set are built as
Mac OS X application bundles on Apple platforms.  Shared library
targets with the FRAMEWORK property set are built as Mac OS X
frameworks on Apple platforms.  Module library targets with the BUNDLE
property set are built as Mac OS X CFBundle bundles on Apple
platforms.  Source files listed in the target with this property set
will be copied to a directory inside the bundle or framework content
folder specified by the property value.  For bundles the content
folder is "<name>.app/Contents".  For frameworks the content folder is
"<name>.framework/Versions/<version>".  For cfbundles the content
folder is "<name>.bundle/Contents" (unless the extension is changed).
See the PUBLIC_HEADER, PRIVATE_HEADER, and RESOURCE target properties
for specifying files meant for Headers, PrivateHeaders, or Resources
directories.
.SS OBJECT_DEPENDS
.sp
Additional files on which a compiled object file depends.
.sp
Specifies a semicolon\-separated list of full\-paths to files on which
any object files compiled from this source file depend.  An object
file will be recompiled if any of the named files is newer than it.
.sp
This property need not be used to specify the dependency of a source
file on a generated header file that it includes.  Although the
property was originally introduced for this purpose, it is no longer
necessary.  If the generated header file is created by a custom
command in the same target as the source file, the automatic
dependency scanning process will recognize the dependency.  If the
generated header file is created by another target, an inter\-target
dependency should be created with the add_dependencies command (if one
does not already exist due to linking relationships).
.SS OBJECT_OUTPUTS
.sp
Additional outputs for a Makefile rule.
.sp
Additional outputs created by compilation of this source file.  If any
of these outputs is missing the object will be recompiled.  This is
supported only on Makefile generators and will be ignored on other
generators.
.SS SYMBOLIC
.sp
Is this just a name for a rule.
.sp
If SYMBOLIC (boolean) is set to true the build system will be informed
that the source file is not actually created on disk but instead used
as a symbolic name for a build rule.
.SS VS_DEPLOYMENT_CONTENT
.sp
Mark a source file as content for deployment with a Windows Phone or
Windows Store application when built with a Visual Studio generator.
The value must evaluate to either \fB1\fP or \fB0\fP and may use
\fBgenerator expressions\fP
to make the choice based on the build configuration.
The \fB\&.vcxproj\fP file entry for the source file will be
marked either \fBDeploymentContent\fP or \fBExcludedFromBuild\fP
for values \fB1\fP and \fB0\fP, respectively.
.SS VS_DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION
.sp
Specifies the deployment location for a content source file with a Windows
Phone or Windows Store application when built with a Visual Studio generator.
This property is only applicable when using \fBVS_DEPLOYMENT_CONTENT\fP\&.
The value represent the path relative to the app package and applies to all
configurations.
.SS VS_SHADER_ENTRYPOINT
.sp
Specifies the name of the entry point for the shader of a \fB\&.hlsl\fP source
file.
.SS VS_SHADER_FLAGS
.sp
Set additional VS shader flags of a \fB\&.hlsl\fP source file.
.SS VS_SHADER_MODEL
.sp
Specifies the shader model of a \fB\&.hlsl\fP source file. Some shader types can
only be used with recent shader models
.SS VS_SHADER_TYPE
.sp
Set the VS shader type of a \fB\&.hlsl\fP source file.
.SS VS_XAML_TYPE
.sp
Mark a XAML source file as a different type than the default \fBPage\fP\&.
The most common usage would be to set the default App.xaml file as
ApplicationDefinition.
.SS WRAP_EXCLUDE
.sp
Exclude this source file from any code wrapping techniques.
.sp
Some packages can wrap source files into alternate languages to
provide additional functionality.  For example, C++ code can be
wrapped into Java or Python etc using SWIG etc.  If WRAP_EXCLUDE is
set to true (1 etc) that indicates that this source file should not be
wrapped.
.SS XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE
.sp
Set the Xcode \fBexplicitFileType\fP attribute on its reference to a
source file.  CMake computes a default based on file extension but
can be told explicitly with this property.
.sp
See also \fBXCODE_LAST_KNOWN_FILE_TYPE\fP\&.
.SS XCODE_LAST_KNOWN_FILE_TYPE
.sp
Set the Xcode \fBlastKnownFileType\fP attribute on its reference to a
source file.  CMake computes a default based on file extension but
can be told explicitly with this property.
.sp
See also \fBXCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE\fP, which is preferred
over this property if set.
.SH PROPERTIES ON CACHE ENTRIES
.SS ADVANCED
.sp
True if entry should be hidden by default in GUIs.
.sp
This is a boolean value indicating whether the entry is considered
interesting only for advanced configuration.  The mark_as_advanced()
command modifies this property.
.SS HELPSTRING
.sp
Help associated with entry in GUIs.
.sp
This string summarizes the purpose of an entry to help users set it
through a CMake GUI.
.SS MODIFIED
.sp
Internal management property.  Do not set or get.
.sp
This is an internal cache entry property managed by CMake to track
interactive user modification of entries.  Ignore it.
.SS STRINGS
.sp
Enumerate possible STRING entry values for GUI selection.
.sp
For cache entries with type STRING, this enumerates a set of values.
CMake GUIs may use this to provide a selection widget instead of a
generic string entry field.  This is for convenience only.  CMake does
not enforce that the value matches one of those listed.
.SS TYPE
.sp
Widget type for entry in GUIs.
.sp
Cache entry values are always strings, but CMake GUIs present widgets
to help users set values.  The GUIs use this property as a hint to
determine the widget type.  Valid TYPE values are:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf

Generally the TYPE of a cache entry should be set by the command which
creates it (set, option, find_library, etc.).
.SS VALUE
.sp
Value of a cache entry.
.sp
This property maps to the actual value of a cache entry.  Setting this
property always sets the value without checking, so use with care.
.SH PROPERTIES ON INSTALLED FILES

Contents of \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>\fP may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP
manual for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

Generator expressions should be preferred instead of setting this property.
.SS POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
.sp
Deprecated install support.
.sp
The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are the old
way to specify CMake scripts to run before and after installing a
target.  They are used only when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is
used to install the target.  Use the INSTALL command instead.
.SS PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT
.sp
Deprecated install support.

.SS COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>
.sp
Ignored.  See CMake Policy \fBCMP0043\fP\&.
.sp
Per\-configuration preprocessor definitions on a source file.
