Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the
remainder.  \fBg++\fR accepts mostly the same options as \fBgcc\fR.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
When you invoke \s-1GCC\s0, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The ``overall options'' allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the \fB\-c\fR option
says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler.
.PP
Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.
.PP
Most of the command line options that you can use with \s-1GCC\s0 are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually \*(C+), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.
.PP
The \fBgcc\fR program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may \fInot\fR be grouped: \fB\-dr\fR is very different from \fB\-d\ \-r\fR.
.PP
You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several options
of the same kind; for example, if you specify \fB\-L\fR more than once,
the directories are searched in the order specified.
.PP
Many options have long names starting with \fB\-f\fR or with
\&\fB\-W\fR\-\-\-for example, \fB\-fforce\-mem\fR,
\&\fB\-fstrength\-reduce\fR, \fB\-Wformat\fR and so on.  Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
\&\fB\-ffoo\fR would be \fB\-fno\-foo\fR.  This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.

.Sh "Options Controlling the Kind of Output"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling the Kind of Output"
Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  \s-1GCC\s0 is capable of
preprocessing and compiling several files either into several
assembler input files, or into one assembler input file; then each
assembler input file produces an object file, and linking combines all
the object files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input)
into an executable file.
.PP
For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:
.IP "\fIfile\fR\fB.c\fR" 4
.IX Item "file.c"
C source code which must be preprocessed.
.IP "\fIfile\fR\fB.i\fR" 4
.IX Item "file.i"
C source code which should not be preprocessed.
.IP "\fIfile\fR\fB.ii\fR" 4
.IX Item "file.ii"
\&\*(C+ source code which should not be preprocessed.
.IP "\fIfile\fR\fB.m\fR" 4
.IX Item "file.m"
Objective-C source code.  Note that you must link with the library
\&\fIlibobjc.a\fR to make an Objective-C program work.
.IP "\fIfile\fR\fB.mi\fR" 4
.IX Item "file.mi"
Objective-C source code which should not be preprocessed.
.IP "\fIfile\fR\fB.h\fR" 4

.PD
\&\*(C+ source code which must be preprocessed.  Note that in \fB.cxx\fR,
the last two letters must both be literally \fBx\fR.  Likewise,
\&\fB.C\fR refers to a literal capital C.
.IP "\fIfile\fR\fB.hh\fR" 4
.IX Item "file.hh"
.PD 0
.IP "\fIfile\fR\fB.H\fR" 4
.IX Item "file.H"

.PD 0
.IP "\fIfile\fR\fB.fpp\fR" 4
.IX Item "file.fpp"
.IP "\fIfile\fR\fB.FPP\fR" 4
.IX Item "file.FPP"
.PD
Fortran source code which must be preprocessed (with the traditional
preprocessor).
.IP "\fIfile\fR\fB.r\fR" 4
.IX Item "file.r"
Fortran source code which must be preprocessed with a \s-1RATFOR\s0
preprocessor (not included with \s-1GCC\s0).
.IP "\fIfile\fR\fB.ads\fR" 4
.IX Item "file.ads"
Ada source code file which contains a library unit declaration (a
declaration of a package, subprogram, or generic, or a generic
instantiation), or a library unit renaming declaration (a package,
generic, or subprogram renaming declaration).  Such files are also
called \fIspecs\fR.
.IP "\fIfile\fR\fB.adb\fR" 4
.IX Item "file.adb"
Ada source code file containing a library unit body (a subprogram or
package body).  Such files are also called \fIbodies\fR.
.IP "\fIfile\fR\fB.s\fR" 4
.IX Item "file.s"
Assembler code.
.IP "\fIfile\fR\fB.S\fR" 4
.IX Item "file.S"
Assembler code which must be preprocessed.
.IP "\fIother\fR" 4
.IX Item "other"
An object file to be fed straight into linking.
Any file name with no recognized suffix is treated this way.
.PP
You can specify the input language explicitly with the \fB\-x\fR option:
.IP "\fB\-x\fR \fIlanguage\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x language"
Specify explicitly the \fIlanguage\fR for the following input files
(rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on the file
name suffix).  This option applies to all following input files until
the next \fB\-x\fR option.  Possible values for \fIlanguage\fR are:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&        c  c-header  cpp-output
\&        c++  c++-header  c++-cpp-output
\&        objective-c  objective-c-header  objc-cpp-output
\&        assembler  assembler-with-cpp
\&        ada
\&        f77  f77-cpp-input  ratfor
\&        java
\&        treelang
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-x none\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x none"
Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files are
handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if \fB\-x\fR
has not been used at all).
.IP "\fB\-pass\-exit\-codes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pass-exit-codes"
Normally the \fBgcc\fR program will exit with the code of 1 if any
phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code.  If you specify
\&\fB\-pass\-exit\-codes\fR, the \fBgcc\fR program will instead return with
numerically highest error produced by any phase that returned an error
indication.
.PP
If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
\&\fB\-x\fR (or filename suffixes) to tell \fBgcc\fR where to start, and
one of the options \fB\-c\fR, \fB\-S\fR, or \fB\-E\fR to say where
\&\fBgcc\fR is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,
\&\fB\-x cpp-output \-E\fR) instruct \fBgcc\fR to do nothing at all.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c"
Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
object file for each source file.
.Sp
By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix \fB.c\fR, \fB.i\fR, \fB.s\fR, etc., with \fB.o\fR.
.Sp
Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S"
Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output
is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
file specified.
.Sp
By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by

\&\*(C+ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes \fB.C\fR,
\&\fB.cc\fR, \fB.cpp\fR, \fB.CPP\fR, \fB.c++\fR, \fB.cp\fR, or
\&\fB.cxx\fR; \*(C+ header files often use \fB.hh\fR or \fB.H\fR; and
preprocessed \*(C+ files use the suffix \fB.ii\fR.  \s-1GCC\s0 recognizes
files with these names and compiles them as \*(C+ programs even if you
call the compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually
with the name \fBgcc\fR).
.PP
However, \*(C+ programs often require class libraries as well as a
compiler that understands the \*(C+ language\-\-\-and under some
circumstances, you might want to compile programs or header files from
standard input, or otherwise without a suffix that flags them as \*(C+
programs.  You might also like to precompile a C header file with a
\&\fB.h\fR extension to be used in \*(C+ compilations.  \fBg++\fR is a
program that calls \s-1GCC\s0 with the default language set to \*(C+, and
automatically specifies linking against the \*(C+ library.  On many
systems, \fBg++\fR is also installed with the name \fBc++\fR.
.PP
When you compile \*(C+ programs, you may specify many of the same
command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
languages; or options that are meaningful only for \*(C+ programs.

In C mode, support all \s-1ISO\s0 C90 programs.  In \*(C+ mode,
remove \s-1GNU\s0 extensions that conflict with \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+.
.Sp
This turns off certain features of \s-1GCC\s0 that are incompatible with \s-1ISO\s0
C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard \*(C+ (when compiling \*(C+ code),
such as the \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR keywords, and
predefined macros such as \f(CW\*(C`unix\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`vax\*(C'\fR that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used \s-1ISO\s0 trigraph feature.  For the C compiler,
it disables recognition of \*(C+ style \fB//\fR comments as well as
the \f(CW\*(C`inline\*(C'\fR keyword.

The alternate keywords \f(CW\*(C`_\|_asm_\|_\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_\|_extension_\|_\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_inline_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_typeof_\|_\*(C'\fR continue to work despite
\&\fB\-ansi\fR.  You would not want to use them in an \s-1ISO\s0 C program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with \fB\-ansi\fR.  Alternate predefined macros
such as \f(CW\*(C`_\|_unix_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_vax_\|_\*(C'\fR are also available, with or
without \fB\-ansi\fR.
.Sp
The \fB\-ansi\fR option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, \fB\-pedantic\fR is required in
addition to \fB\-ansi\fR.  
.Sp
The macro \f(CW\*(C`_\|_STRICT_ANSI_\|_\*(C'\fR is predefined when the \fB\-ansi\fR

from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the

Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with

.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR may become single
instructions that adjust the stack directly, and calls to \f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR
may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.

With the \fB\-fno\-builtin\-\fR\fIfunction\fR option
only the built-in function \fIfunction\fR is

Ideally, a portable program should always use \f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR or

But many programs have been written to use plain \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.

The type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR is always a distinct type from each of

.IP "\fB\-fabi\-version=\fR\fIn\fR" 4

Use version \fIn\fR of the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0.  Version 2 is the version of the

the version that conforms most closely to the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 specification.
Therefore, the \s-1ABI\s0 obtained using version 0 will change as \s-1ABI\s0 bugs

.IP "\fB\-fcheck\-new\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcheck-new"
Check that the pointer returned by \f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
normally unnecessary because the \*(C+ standard specifies that
\&\f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR will only return \f(CW0\fR if it is declared
\&\fB\f(BIthrow()\fB\fR, in which case the compiler will always check the
return value even without this option.  In all other cases, when
\&\f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR has a non-empty exception specification, memory
exhaustion is signalled by throwing \f(CW\*(C`std::bad_alloc\*(C'\fR.  See also
\&\fBnew (nothrow)\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fconserve\-space\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fconserve-space"
Put uninitialized or runtime-initialized global variables into the
common segment, as C does.  This saves space in the executable at the
cost of not diagnosing duplicate definitions.  If you compile with this
flag and your program mysteriously crashes after \f(CW\*(C`main()\*(C'\fR has
completed, you may have an object that is being destroyed twice because
two definitions were merged.

This option is no longer useful on most targets, now that support has

.IX Item "-fno-const-strings"
Give string constants type \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR instead of type \f(CW\*(C`const

the standard.  Even if you use \fB\-fno\-const\-strings\fR, you cannot
actually modify the value of a string constant, unless you also use
\&\fB\-fwritable\-strings\fR.

Don't check for violation of exception specifications at runtime.  This

.IP "\fB\-fno\-rtti\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-rtti"
Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
functions for use by the \*(C+ runtime type identification features
(\fBdynamic_cast\fR and \fBtypeid\fR).  If you don't use those parts
of the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that
exception handling uses the same information, but it will generate it as

This information is generally only useful to the G++ development team.
.IP "\fB\-ftemplate\-depth\-\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftemplate-depth-n"
Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to \fIn\fR.
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation.  \s-1ANSI/ISO\s0 \*(C+
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17.

Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the

This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of static
destructors, but will only work if your C library supports
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_atexit\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-weak\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-weak"
Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the linker.
By default, G++ will use weak symbols if they are available.  This

it will result in inferior code and has no benefits.  This option may
be removed in a future release of G++.
.IP "\fB\-nostdinc++\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nostdinc++"
Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to
\&\*(C+, but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option

.IP "\fB\-fno\-default\-inline\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-default-inline"
Do not assume \fBinline\fR for functions defined inside a class scope.
  Note that these
functions will have linkage like inline functions; they just won't be
inlined by default.
.IP "\fB\-Wabi\fR (\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wabi ( only)"
Warn when G++ generates code that is probably not compatible with the
vendor-neutral \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0.  Although an effort has been made to warn about
all such cases, there are probably some cases that are not warned about,
even though G++ is generating incompatible code.  There may also be
cases where warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated
will be compatible.
.Sp
You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are
concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be binary
compatible with code generated by other compilers.
.Sp
The known incompatibilities at this point include:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
Incorrect handling of tail-padding for bit\-fields.  G++ may attempt to
pack data into the same byte as a base class.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        struct A { virtual void f(); int f1 : 1; };
\&        struct B : public A { int f2 : 1; };
.Ve
.Sp
In this case, G++ will place \f(CW\*(C`B::f2\*(C'\fR into the same byte
as\f(CW\*(C`A::f1\*(C'\fR; other compilers will not.  You can avoid this problem
by explicitly padding \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR so that its size is a multiple of the
byte size on your platform; that will cause G++ and other compilers to
layout \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR identically.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Incorrect handling of tail-padding for virtual bases.  G++ does not use
tail padding when laying out virtual bases.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        struct A { virtual void f(); char c1; };
\&        struct B { B(); char c2; };
\&        struct C : public A, public virtual B {};
.Ve
.Sp
In this case, G++ will not place \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR into the tail-padding for
\&\f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR; other compilers will.  You can avoid this problem by
explicitly padding \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR so that its size is a multiple of its
alignment (ignoring virtual base classes); that will cause G++ and other
compilers to layout \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR identically.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Incorrect handling of bit-fields with declared widths greater than that
of their underlying types, when the bit-fields appear in a union.  For
example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        union U { int i : 4096; };
.Ve
.Sp
Assuming that an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR does not have 4096 bits, G++ will make the
union too small by the number of bits in an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Empty classes can be placed at incorrect offsets.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        struct A {};
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        struct B {
\&          A a;
\&          virtual void f ();
\&        };
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        struct C : public B, public A {};
.Ve
.Sp
G++ will place the \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR base class of \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR at a nonzero offset;
it should be placed at offset zero.  G++ mistakenly believes that the
\&\f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR data member of \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR is already at offset zero.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Names of template functions whose types involve \f(CW\*(C`typename\*(C'\fR or
template template parameters can be mangled incorrectly.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        template <typename Q>
\&        void f(typename Q::X) {}
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        template <template <typename> class Q>
\&        void f(typename Q<int>::X) {}
.Ve
.Sp
Instantiations of these templates may be mangled incorrectly.

Do not warn about usage of deprecated features.  
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-non\-template\-friend\fR (\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-non-template-friend ( only)"
Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are declared
within a template.  Since the advent of explicit template specification
support in G++, if the name of the friend is an unqualified-id (i.e.,
\&\fBfriend foo(int)\fR), the \*(C+ language specification demands that the
friend declare or define an ordinary, nontemplate function.  (Section
14.5.3).  Before G++ implemented explicit specification, unqualified-ids
could be interpreted as a particular specialization of a templatized
function.  Because this non-conforming behavior is no longer the default
behavior for G++, \fB\-Wnon\-template\-friend\fR allows the compiler to
check existing code for potential trouble spots and is on by default.
This new compiler behavior can be turned off with
\&\fB\-Wno\-non\-template\-friend\fR which keeps the conformant compiler code
but disables the helpful warning.
.IP "\fB\-Wold\-style\-cast\fR (\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wold-style-cast ( only)"
Warn if an old-style (C\-style) cast to a non-void type is used within
a \*(C+ program.  The new-style casts (\fBstatic_cast\fR,
\&\fBreinterpret_cast\fR, and \fBconst_cast\fR) are less vulnerable to
unintended effects and much easier to search for.
.IP "\fB\-Woverloaded\-virtual\fR (\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Woverloaded-virtual ( only)"
Warn when a function declaration hides virtual functions from a
base class.  For example, in:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        struct A {
\&          virtual void f();
\&        };
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        struct B: public A {

.Ve
.Sp
the \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR class version of \f(CW\*(C`f\*(C'\fR is hidden in \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR, and code
like:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        B* b;
\&        b->f();
.Ve
.Sp
will fail to compile.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-pmf\-conversions\fR (\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-pmf-conversions ( only)"
Disable the diagnostic for converting a bound pointer to member function
to a plain pointer.
.IP "\fB\-Wsign\-promo\fR (\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wsign-promo ( only)"
Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or
enumerated type to a signed type, over a conversion to an unsigned type of
the same size.  Previous versions of G++ would try to preserve
unsignedness, but the standard mandates the current behavior.
.IP "\fB\-Wsynth\fR (\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wsynth ( only)"
Warn when G++'s synthesis behavior does not match that of cfront.  For
instance:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        struct A {
\&          operator int ();
\&          A& operator = (int);
\&        };

\&        {
\&          A a,b;
\&          a = b;

.Ve
.Sp
In this example, G++ will synthesize a default \fBA& operator =

(\s-1NOTE:\s0 This manual does not describe the Objective-C language itself.  See
<\fBhttp://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html\fR> for references.)
.PP
This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for Objective-C programs, but you can also use most of the \s-1GNU\s0 compiler
options regardless of what language your program is in.  For example,
you might compile a file \f(CW\*(C`some_class.m\*(C'\fR like this:

In this example, \fB\-fgnu\-runtime\fR is an option meant only for
Objective-C programs; you can use the other options with any language
supported by \s-1GCC\s0.

Here is a list of options that are \fIonly\fR for compiling Objective-C
programs:
.IP "\fB\-fconstant\-string\-class=\fR\fIclass-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fconstant-string-class=class-name"
Use \fIclass-name\fR as the name of the class to instantiate for each
literal string specified with the syntax \f(CW\*(C`@"..."\*(C'\fR.  The default
class name is \f(CW\*(C`NXConstantString\*(C'\fR if the \s-1GNU\s0 runtime is being used, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`NSConstantString\*(C'\fR if the NeXT runtime is being used (see below).  The
\&\fB\-fconstant\-cfstrings\fR option, if also present, will override the
\&\fB\-fconstant\-string\-class\fR setting and cause \f(CW\*(C`@"..."\*(C'\fR literals
to be laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings.
.IP "\fB\-fgnu\-runtime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgnu-runtime"
Generate object code compatible with the standard \s-1GNU\s0 Objective-C
runtime.  This is the default for most types of systems.
.IP "\fB\-fnext\-runtime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fnext-runtime"
Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is the default
for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac \s-1OS\s0 X.  The macro
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_NEXT_RUNTIME_\|_\*(C'\fR is predefined if (and only if) this option is
used.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-nil\-receivers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-nil-receivers"
Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches (e.g.,
\&\f(CW\*(C`[receiver message:arg]\*(C'\fR) in this translation unit ensure that the receiver
is not \f(CW\*(C`nil\*(C'\fR.  This allows for more efficient entry points in the runtime to be

Enable syntactic support for structured exception handling in Objective\-C,

The \f(CW@throw\fR statement may appear anywhere in an Objective-C or
Objective\-\*(C+ program; when used inside of a \f(CW@catch\fR block, the
\&\f(CW@throw\fR may appear without an argument (as shown above), in which case
the object caught by the \f(CW@catch\fR will be rethrown.
.Sp
Note that only (pointers to) Objective-C objects may be thrown and
caught using this scheme.  When an object is thrown, it will be caught
by the nearest \f(CW@catch\fR clause capable of handling objects of that type,
analogously to how \f(CW\*(C`catch\*(C'\fR blocks work in \*(C+ and Java.  A
\&\f(CW\*(C`@catch(id ...)\*(C'\fR clause (as shown above) may also be provided to catch
any and all Objective-C exceptions not caught by previous \f(CW@catch\fR
clauses (if any).
.Sp
The \f(CW@finally\fR clause, if present, will be executed upon exit from the
immediately preceding \f(CW\*(C`@try ... @catch\*(C'\fR section.  This will happen
regardless of whether any exceptions are thrown, caught or rethrown
inside the \f(CW\*(C`@try ... @catch\*(C'\fR section, analogously to the behavior
of the \f(CW\*(C`finally\*(C'\fR clause in Java.
.Sp
There are several caveats to using the new exception mechanism:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
Although currently designed to be binary compatible with \f(CW\*(C`NS_HANDLER\*(C'\fR\-style
idioms provided by the \f(CW\*(C`NSException\*(C'\fR class, the new
exceptions can only be used on Mac \s-1OS\s0 X 10.3 (Panther) and later
systems, due to additional functionality needed in the (NeXT) Objective-C
runtime.
.IP "\(bu" 4
As mentioned above, the new exceptions do not support handling
types other than Objective-C objects.   Furthermore, when used from
Objective\-\*(C+, the Objective-C exception model does not interoperate with \*(C+
exceptions at this time.  This means you cannot \f(CW@throw\fR an exception
from Objective-C and \f(CW\*(C`catch\*(C'\fR it in \*(C+, or vice versa
(i.e., \f(CW\*(C`throw ... @catch\*(C'\fR).
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
The \fB\-fobjc\-exceptions\fR switch also enables the use of synchronization
blocks for thread-safe execution:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&          @synchronized (ObjCClass *guard) {
\&            ...
\&          }
.Ve
.Sp
Upon entering the \f(CW@synchronized\fR block, a thread of execution shall
first check whether a lock has been placed on the corresponding \f(CW\*(C`guard\*(C'\fR
object by another thread.  If it has, the current thread shall wait until
the other thread relinquishes its lock.  Once \f(CW\*(C`guard\*(C'\fR becomes available,
the current thread will place its own lock on it, execute the code contained in
the \f(CW@synchronized\fR block, and finally relinquish the lock (thereby
making \f(CW\*(C`guard\*(C'\fR available to other threads).
.Sp
Unlike Java, Objective-C does not allow for entire methods to be marked
\&\f(CW@synchronized\fR.  Note that throwing exceptions out of
\&\f(CW@synchronized\fR blocks is allowed, and will cause the guarding object
to be unlocked properly.

.IP "\fB\-freplace\-objc\-classes\fR" 4

Emit a special marker instructing \fB\f(BIld\fB\|(1)\fR not to statically link in

When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily replaces calls
to \f(CW\*(C`objc_getClass("...")\*(C'\fR (when the name of the class is known at
compile time) with static class references that get initialized at load time,
which improves run-time performance.  Specifying the \fB\-fzero\-link\fR flag
suppresses this behavior and causes calls to \f(CW\*(C`objc_getClass("...")\*(C'\fR
to be retained.  This is useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows
for individual class implementations to be modified during program execution.

If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for
every method in the protocol that is not implemented by the class.  The
default behavior is to issue a warning for every method not explicitly
implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is inherited
from the superclass.  If you use the \f(CW\*(C`\-Wno\-protocol\*(C'\fR option, then
methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be implemented,
and no warning is issued for them.
.IP "\fB\-Wselector\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wselector"
Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector are
found during compilation.  The check is performed on the list of methods
in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally, a check is performed
for each selector appearing in a \f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR
expression, and a corresponding method for that selector has been found
during compilation.  Because these checks scan the method table only at
the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the final
stage of compilation is not reached, for example because an error is
found during compilation, or because the \f(CW\*(C`\-fsyntax\-only\*(C'\fR option is
being used.
.IP "\fB\-Wundeclared\-selector\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wundeclared-selector"
Warn if a \f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR expression referring to an

method with that name has been declared before the
\&\f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR expression, either explicitly in an
\&\f(CW@interface\fR or \f(CW@protocol\fR declaration, or implicitly in
an \f(CW@implementation\fR section.  This option always performs its
checks as soon as a \f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR expression is found,
while \f(CW\*(C`\-Wselector\*(C'\fR only performs its checks in the final stage of

algorithm, e.g. how many characters per line, how often source location
information should be reported.  Right now, only the \*(C+ front end can

Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic messages

Valid \s-1ISO\s0 C and \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few will require \fB\-ansi\fR or a
\&\fB\-std\fR option specifying the required version of \s-1ISO\s0 C).  However,
without this option, certain \s-1GNU\s0 extensions and traditional C and \*(C+
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.
.Sp
\&\fB\-pedantic\fR does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with \fB_\|_\fR.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_extension_\|_\*(C'\fR.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.
.Sp
Some users try to use \fB\-pedantic\fR to check programs for strict \s-1ISO\s0
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all\-\-\-only those for which
\&\s-1ISO\s0 C \fIrequires\fR a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.
.Sp
A feature to report any failure to conform to \s-1ISO\s0 C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from \fB\-pedantic\fR.  We don't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.
.Sp
Where the standard specified with \fB\-std\fR represents a \s-1GNU\s0
extended dialect of C, such as \fBgnu89\fR or \fBgnu99\fR, there is a
corresponding \fIbase standard\fR, the version of \s-1ISO\s0 C on which the \s-1GNU\s0
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from \fB\-pedantic\fR are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It would not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified \s-1GNU\s0
C dialect, since by definition the \s-1GNU\s0 dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)
.IP "\fB\-pedantic\-errors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic-errors"
Like \fB\-pedantic\fR, except that errors are produced rather than
warnings.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR" 4
.IX Item "-w"
Inhibit all warning messages.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-import\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-import"
Inhibit warning messages about the use of \fB#import\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wchar\-subscripts\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wchar-subscripts"
Warn if an array subscript has type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR.  This is a common cause
of error, as programmers often forget that this type is signed on some
machines.
.IP "\fB\-Wcomment\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wcomment"
Warn whenever a comment-start sequence \fB/*\fR appears in a \fB/*\fR
comment, or whenever a Backslash-Newline appears in a \fB//\fR comment.
.IP "\fB\-Wformat\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wformat"
Check calls to \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`scanf\*(C'\fR, etc., to make sure that
the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
specified, and that the conversions specified in the format string make
sense.  This includes standard functions, and others specified by format
attributes, in the \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`scanf\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`strfmon\*(C'\fR (an X/Open extension,
not in the C standard) families.
.Sp
The formats are checked against the format features supported by \s-1GNU\s0
libc version 2.2.  These include all \s-1ISO\s0 C90 and C99 features, as well
as features from the Single Unix Specification and some \s-1BSD\s0 and \s-1GNU\s0
extensions.  Other library implementations may not support all these
features; \s-1GCC\s0 does not support warning about features that go beyond a
particular library's limitations.  However, if \fB\-pedantic\fR is used
with \fB\-Wformat\fR, warnings will be given about format features not
in the selected standard version (but not for \f(CW\*(C`strfmon\*(C'\fR formats,
since those are not in any version of the C standard).  
.Sp
Since \fB\-Wformat\fR also checks for null format arguments for
several functions, \fB\-Wformat\fR also implies \fB\-Wnonnull\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\-Wformat\fR is included in \fB\-Wall\fR.  For more control over some
aspects of format checking, the options \fB\-Wformat\-y2k\fR,
\&\fB\-Wno\-format\-extra\-args\fR, \fB\-Wno\-format\-zero\-length\fR,
\&\fB\-Wformat\-nonliteral\fR, \fB\-Wformat\-security\fR, and
\&\fB\-Wformat=2\fR are available, but are not included in \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wformat\-y2k\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wformat-y2k"
If \fB\-Wformat\fR is specified, also warn about \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR
formats which may yield only a two-digit year.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-format\-extra\-args\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-format-extra-args"
If \fB\-Wformat\fR is specified, do not warn about excess arguments to a
\&\f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`scanf\*(C'\fR format function.  The C standard specifies
that such arguments are ignored.
.Sp
Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments that are
specified with \fB$\fR operand number specifications, normally
warnings are still given, since the implementation could not know what
type to pass to \f(CW\*(C`va_arg\*(C'\fR to skip the unused arguments.  However,
in the case of \f(CW\*(C`scanf\*(C'\fR formats, this option will suppress the
warning if the unused arguments are all pointers, since the Single
Unix Specification says that such unused arguments are allowed.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-format\-zero\-length\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-format-zero-length"
If \fB\-Wformat\fR is specified, do not warn about zero-length formats.
The C standard specifies that zero-length formats are allowed.
.IP "\fB\-Wformat\-nonliteral\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wformat-nonliteral"
If \fB\-Wformat\fR is specified, also warn if the format string is not a
string literal and so cannot be checked, unless the format function
takes its format arguments as a \f(CW\*(C`va_list\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wformat\-security\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wformat-security"
If \fB\-Wformat\fR is specified, also warn about uses of format
functions that represent possible security problems.  At present, this
warns about calls to \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`scanf\*(C'\fR functions where the
format string is not a string literal and there are no format arguments,
as in \f(CW\*(C`printf (foo);\*(C'\fR.  This may be a security hole if the format
string came from untrusted input and contains \fB%n\fR.  (This is
currently a subset of what \fB\-Wformat\-nonliteral\fR warns about, but
in future warnings may be added to \fB\-Wformat\-security\fR that are not
included in \fB\-Wformat\-nonliteral\fR.)
.IP "\fB\-Wformat=2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wformat=2"
Enable \fB\-Wformat\fR plus format checks not included in
\&\fB\-Wformat\fR.  Currently equivalent to \fB\-Wformat
\&\-Wformat\-nonliteral \-Wformat\-security \-Wformat\-y2k\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wnonnull\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wnonnull"
Warn about passing a null pointer for arguments marked as
requiring a non-null value by the \f(CW\*(C`nonnull\*(C'\fR function attribute.
.Sp
\&\fB\-Wnonnull\fR is included in \fB\-Wall\fR and \fB\-Wformat\fR.  It
can be disabled with the \fB\-Wno\-nonnull\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-Winit\-self\fR (C, \*(C+, and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Winit-self (C, , and Objective-C only)"
Warn about uninitialized variables which are initialized with themselves.
Note this option can only be used with the \fB\-Wuninitialized\fR option,
which in turn only works with \fB\-O1\fR and above.
.Sp
For example, \s-1GCC\s0 will warn about \f(CW\*(C`i\*(C'\fR being uninitialized in the
following snippet only when \fB\-Winit\-self\fR has been specified:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        int f()
\&        {
\&          int i = i;
\&          return i;
\&        }
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-Wimplicit\-int\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wimplicit-int"
Warn when a declaration does not specify a type.
.IP "\fB\-Wimplicit\-function\-declaration\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wimplicit-function-declaration"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-Werror\-implicit\-function\-declaration\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Werror-implicit-function-declaration"
.PD
Give a warning (or error) whenever a function is used before being
declared.
.IP "\fB\-Wimplicit\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wimplicit"
Same as \fB\-Wimplicit\-int\fR and \fB\-Wimplicit\-function\-declaration\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wmain\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmain"
Warn if the type of \fBmain\fR is suspicious.  \fBmain\fR should be a
function with external linkage, returning int, taking either zero
arguments, two, or three arguments of appropriate types.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-braces\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-braces"
Warn if an aggregate or union initializer is not fully bracketed.  In
the following example, the initializer for \fBa\fR is not fully
bracketed, but that for \fBb\fR is fully bracketed.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        int a[2][2] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
\&        int b[2][2] = { { 0, 1 }, { 2, 3 } };
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-Wparentheses\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wparentheses"
Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such
as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.
.Sp
Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
\&\f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement an \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR branch belongs.  Here is an example of
such a case:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        {
\&          if (a)
\&            if (b)
\&              foo ();
\&          else
\&            bar ();
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
In C, every \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR branch belongs to the innermost possible \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR
statement, which in this example is \f(CW\*(C`if (b)\*(C'\fR.  This is often not
what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above example by
indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the potential for this
confusion, \s-1GCC\s0 will issue a warning when this flag is specified.
To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around the innermost
\&\f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement so there is no way the \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR could belong to
the enclosing \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR.  The resulting code would look like this:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&        {
\&          if (a)
\&            {
\&              if (b)
\&                foo ();
\&              else
\&                bar ();
\&            }
\&        }
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-Wsequence\-point\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsequence-point"
Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations
of sequence point rules in the C standard.
.Sp
The C standard defines the order in which expressions in a C program are
evaluated in terms of \fIsequence points\fR, which represent a partial
ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those executed
before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These occur
after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part of a
larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
\&\f(CW\*(C`&&\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`||\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`? :\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`,\*(C'\fR (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places.
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.
.Sp
It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C standard specifies that ``Between the
previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored value
modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.  Furthermore,
the prior value shall be read only to determine the value to be
stored.''.  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.
.Sp
Examples of code with undefined behavior are \f(CW\*(C`a = a++;\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`a[n]
= b[n++]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`a[i++] = i;\*(C'\fR.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.
.Sp
The present implementation of this option only works for C programs.  A
future implementation may also work for \*(C+ programs.
.Sp
The C standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.
Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed formal
definitions, may be found on the \s-1GCC\s0 readings page, at
<\fBhttp://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html\fR>.
.IP "\fB\-Wreturn\-type\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wreturn-type"
Warn whenever a function is defined with a return-type that defaults to
\&\f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR.  Also warn about any \f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR statement with no
return-value in a function whose return-type is not \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
For \*(C+, a function without return type always produces a diagnostic
message, even when \fB\-Wno\-return\-type\fR is specified.  The only
exceptions are \fBmain\fR and functions defined in system headers.
.IP "\fB\-Wswitch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wswitch"
Warn whenever a \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement has an index of enumerated type
and lacks a \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  (The presence of a \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR label prevents this
warning.)  \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used.
.IP "\fB\-Wswitch\-default\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wswitch-default"
Warn whenever a \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement does not have a \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR
case.
.IP "\fB\-Wswitch\-enum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wswitch-enum"
Warn whenever a \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement has an index of enumerated type
and lacks a \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used.
.IP "\fB\-Wtrigraphs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wtrigraphs"
Warn if any trigraphs are encountered that might change the meaning of
the program (trigraphs within comments are not warned about).
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-function\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-function"
Warn whenever a static function is declared but not defined or a
non\e\-inline static function is unused.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-label\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-label"
Warn whenever a label is declared but not used.
.Sp
To suppress this warning use the \fBunused\fR attribute.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-parameter\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-parameter"
Warn whenever a function parameter is unused aside from its declaration.
.Sp
To suppress this warning use the \fBunused\fR attribute.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-variable\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-variable"
Warn whenever a local variable or non-constant static variable is unused
aside from its declaration
.Sp
To suppress this warning use the \fBunused\fR attribute.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-value\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-value"
Warn whenever a statement computes a result that is explicitly not used.
.Sp
To suppress this warning cast the expression to \fBvoid\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused"
All the above \fB\-Wunused\fR options combined.
.Sp
In order to get a warning about an unused function parameter, you must
either specify \fB\-Wextra \-Wunused\fR (note that \fB\-Wall\fR implies
\&\fB\-Wunused\fR), or separately specify \fB\-Wunused\-parameter\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wuninitialized\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wuninitialized"
Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being initialized or
if a variable may be clobbered by a \f(CW\*(C`setjmp\*(C'\fR call.
.Sp
These warnings are possible only in optimizing compilation,
because they require data flow information that is computed only
when optimizing.  If you don't specify \fB\-O\fR, you simply won't
get these warnings.
.Sp
If you want to warn about code which uses the uninitialized value of the
variable in its own initializer, use the \fB\-Winit\-self\fR option.
.Sp
These warnings occur only for variables that are candidates for
register allocation.  Therefore, they do not occur for a variable that
is declared \f(CW\*(C`volatile\*(C'\fR, or whose address is taken, or whose size
is other than 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.  Also, they do not occur for
structures, unions or arrays, even when they are in registers.
.Sp
Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.
.Sp
These warnings are made optional because \s-1GCC\s0 is not smart
enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
despite appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
this can happen:
.Sp
.Vb 12
\&        {
\&          int x;
\&          switch (y)
\&            {
\&            case 1: x = 1;
\&              break;
\&            case 2: x = 4;
\&              break;
\&            case 3: x = 5;
\&            }
\&          foo (x);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
If the value of \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR is always 1, 2 or 3, then \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is
always initialized, but \s-1GCC\s0 doesn't know this.  Here is
another common case:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&        {
\&          int save_y;
\&          if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
\&          ...
\&          if (change_y) y = save_y;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
This has no bug because \f(CW\*(C`save_y\*(C'\fR is used only if it is set.
.Sp
This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be
changed by a call to \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR.  These warnings as well are possible
only in optimizing compilation.
.Sp
The compiler sees only the calls to \f(CW\*(C`setjmp\*(C'\fR.  It cannot know
where \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR cannot
in fact be called at the place which would cause a problem.
.Sp
Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions
you use that never return as \f(CW\*(C`noreturn\*(C'\fR.  
.IP "\fB\-Wunknown\-pragmas\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunknown-pragmas"
Warn when a #pragma directive is encountered which is not understood by
\&\s-1GCC\s0.  If this command line option is used, warnings will even be issued
for unknown pragmas in system header files.  This is not the case if
the warnings were only enabled by the \fB\-Wall\fR command line option.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-aliasing"
This option is only active when \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR is active.
It warns about code which might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization. The warning does not catch all
cases, but does attempt to catch the more common pitfalls. It is
included in \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wall\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wall"
All of the above \fB\-W\fR options combined.  This enables all the
warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable, and
that are easy to avoid (or modify to prevent the warning), even in
conjunction with macros.  This also enables some language-specific
warnings described in \fB\*(C+ Dialect Options\fR and
\&\fBObjective-C Dialect Options\fR.
.PP
The following \fB\-W...\fR options are not implied by \fB\-Wall\fR.
Some of them warn about constructions that users generally do not
consider questionable, but which occasionally you might wish to check
for; others warn about constructions that are necessary or hard to avoid
in some cases, and there is no simple way to modify the code to suppress
the warning.
.IP "\fB\-Wextra\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wextra"
(This option used to be called \fB\-W\fR.  The older name is still
supported, but the newer name is more descriptive.)  Print extra warning
messages for these events:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
A function can return either with or without a value.  (Falling
off the end of the function body is considered returning without
a value.)  For example, this function would evoke such a
warning:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        foo (a)
\&        {
\&          if (a > 0)
\&            return a;
\&        }
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
An expression-statement or the left-hand side of a comma expression
contains no side effects.
To suppress the warning, cast the unused expression to void.
For example, an expression such as \fBx[i,j]\fR will cause a warning,
but \fBx[(void)i,j]\fR will not.
.IP "\(bu" 4
An unsigned value is compared against zero with \fB<\fR or \fB>=\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A comparison like \fBx<=y<=z\fR appears; this is equivalent to
\&\fB(x<=y ? 1 : 0) <= z\fR, which is a different interpretation from
that of ordinary mathematical notation.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Storage-class specifiers like \f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR are not the first things in
a declaration.  According to the C Standard, this usage is obsolescent.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The return type of a function has a type qualifier such as \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR.
Such a type qualifier has no effect, since the value returned by a
function is not an lvalue.  (But don't warn about the \s-1GNU\s0 extension of
\&\f(CW\*(C`volatile void\*(C'\fR return types.  That extension will be warned about
if \fB\-pedantic\fR is specified.)
.IP "\(bu" 4
If \fB\-Wall\fR or \fB\-Wunused\fR is also specified, warn about unused
arguments.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce an
incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned.
(But don't warn if \fB\-Wno\-sign\-compare\fR is also specified.)
.IP "\(bu" 4
An aggregate has an initializer which does not initialize all members.
For example, the following code would cause such a warning, because
\&\f(CW\*(C`x.h\*(C'\fR would be implicitly initialized to zero:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        struct s { int f, g, h; };
\&        struct s x = { 3, 4 };

.IP "\fB\-Wsystem\-headers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsystem-headers"
Print warning messages for constructs found in system header files.
Warnings from system headers are normally suppressed, on the assumption
that they usually do not indicate real problems and would only make the
compiler output harder to read.  Using this command line option tells
\&\s-1GCC\s0 to emit warnings from system headers as if they occurred in user
code.  However, note that using \fB\-Wall\fR in conjunction with this
option will \fInot\fR warn about unknown pragmas in system
headers\-\-\-for that, \fB\-Wunknown\-pragmas\fR must also be used.
.IP "\fB\-Wfloat\-equal\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wfloat-equal"
Warn if floating point values are used in equality comparisons.
.Sp
The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
would check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.
.IP "\fB\-Wtraditional\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wtraditional (C only)"
Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
\&\s-1ISO\s0 C.  Also warn about \s-1ISO\s0 C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and/or problematic constructs which should be avoided.
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body.
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but does not in \s-1ISO\s0 C.
.IP "\(bu" 4
In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.
Traditional preprocessors would only consider a line to be a directive
if the \fB#\fR appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
\&\fB\-Wtraditional\fR warns about directives that traditional C
understands but would ignore because the \fB#\fR does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
\&\fB#pragma\fR not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations would not recognize \fB#elif\fR, so it
suggests avoiding it altogether.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A function-like macro that appears without arguments.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The unary plus operator.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \fBU\fR integer constant suffix, or the \fBF\fR or \fBL\fR floating point
constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the \fBL\fR suffix on integer
constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in the system
headers of most modern systems, e.g. the \fB_MIN\fR/\fB_MAX\fR macros in \f(CW\*(C`<limits.h>\*(C'\fR.
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
warnings, however \s-1GCC\s0's integrated preprocessor has enough context to
avoid warning in these cases.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement has an operand of type \f(CW\*(C`long\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A non\-\f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR function declaration follows a \f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR one.
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \s-1ISO\s0 type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which
typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Usage of \s-1ISO\s0 string concatenation is detected.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Initialization of automatic aggregates.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
user code appears conditioned on e.g. \f(CW\*(C`_\|_STDC_\|_\*(C'\fR to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the
traditional C case.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating point values and vice
versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C would cause serious problems.  This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings, for the full set use \fB\-Wconversion\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Use of \s-1ISO\s0 C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is
\&\fInot\fR issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these \s-1ISO\s0 C features will appear in your code when using
libiberty's traditional C compatibility macros, \f(CW\*(C`PARAMS\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`VPARAMS\*(C'\fR.  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a \s-1GCC\s0 extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.

.IP "\fB\-Wdeclaration\-after\-statement\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wdeclaration-after-statement (C only)"
Warn when a declaration is found after a statement in a block.  This
construct, known from \*(C+, was introduced with \s-1ISO\s0 C99 and is by default
allowed in \s-1GCC\s0.  It is not supported by \s-1ISO\s0 C90 and was not supported by
\&\s-1GCC\s0 versions before \s-1GCC\s0 3.0.

.IP "\fB\-Wlarger\-than\-\fR\fIlen\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wlarger-than-len"
Warn whenever an object of larger than \fIlen\fR bytes is defined.
.IP "\fB\-Wpointer\-arith\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpointer-arith"
Warn about anything that depends on the ``size of'' a function type or
of \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR.  \s-1GNU\s0 C assigns these types a size of 1, for
convenience in calculations with \f(CW\*(C`void *\*(C'\fR pointers and pointers
to functions.
.IP "\fB\-Wbad\-function\-cast\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wbad-function-cast (C only)"
Warn whenever a function call is cast to a non-matching type.
For example, warn if \f(CW\*(C`int malloc()\*(C'\fR is cast to \f(CW\*(C`anything *\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wcast\-qual\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wcast-qual"
Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier from
the target type.  For example, warn if a \f(CW\*(C`const char *\*(C'\fR is cast
to an ordinary \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wcast\-align\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wcast-align"
Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment of the
target is increased.  For example, warn if a \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR is cast to
an \f(CW\*(C`int *\*(C'\fR on machines where integers can only be accessed at
two\- or four-byte boundaries.
.IP "\fB\-Wwrite\-strings\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wwrite-strings"
When compiling C, give string constants the type \f(CW\*(C`const
char[\f(CIlength\f(CW]\*(C'\fR so that
copying the address of one into a non\-\f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR
pointer will get a warning; when compiling \*(C+, warn about the
deprecated conversion from string constants to \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR.
These warnings will help you find at
compile time code that can try to write into a string constant, but
only if you have been very careful about using \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR in
declarations and prototypes.  Otherwise, it will just be a nuisance;
this is why we did not make \fB\-Wall\fR request these warnings.
.IP "\fB\-Wconversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wconversion"
Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different from what
would happen to the same argument in the absence of a prototype.  This
includes conversions of fixed point to floating and vice versa, and
conversions changing the width or signedness of a fixed point argument
except when the same as the default promotion.
.Sp
Also, warn if a negative integer constant expression is implicitly
converted to an unsigned type.  For example, warn about the assignment
\&\f(CW\*(C`x = \-1\*(C'\fR if \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is unsigned.  But do not warn about explicit
casts like \f(CW\*(C`(unsigned) \-1\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wsign\-compare\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsign-compare"
Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce
an incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned.
This warning is also enabled by \fB\-Wextra\fR; to get the other warnings
of \fB\-Wextra\fR without this warning, use \fB\-Wextra \-Wno\-sign\-compare\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Waggregate\-return\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Waggregate-return"
Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined or
called.  (In languages where you can return an array, this also elicits
a warning.)
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-prototypes\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-prototypes (C only)"
Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the
argument types.  (An old-style function definition is permitted without
a warning if preceded by a declaration which specifies the argument
types.)
.IP "\fB\-Wold\-style\-definition\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wold-style-definition (C only)"
Warn if an old-style function definition is used.  A warning is given
even if there is a previous prototype.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-prototypes\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-prototypes (C only)"
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype
declaration.  This warning is issued even if the definition itself
provides a prototype.  The aim is to detect global functions that fail
to be declared in header files.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-declarations\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-declarations (C only)"
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous declaration.
Do so even if the definition itself provides a prototype.
Use this option to detect global functions that are not declared in
header files.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-noreturn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-noreturn"
Warn about functions which might be candidates for attribute \f(CW\*(C`noreturn\*(C'\fR.
Note these are only possible candidates, not absolute ones.  Care should
be taken to manually verify functions actually do not ever return before
adding the \f(CW\*(C`noreturn\*(C'\fR attribute, otherwise subtle code generation
bugs could be introduced.  You will not get a warning for \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR in
hosted C environments.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-format\-attribute\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-format-attribute"
If \fB\-Wformat\fR is enabled, also warn about functions which might be
candidates for \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR attributes.  Note these are only possible
candidates, not absolute ones.  \s-1GCC\s0 will guess that \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR
attributes might be appropriate for any function that calls a function
like \f(CW\*(C`vprintf\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`vscanf\*(C'\fR, but this might not always be the
case, and some functions for which \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR attributes are
appropriate may not be detected.  This option has no effect unless
\&\fB\-Wformat\fR is enabled (possibly by \fB\-Wall\fR).
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-multichar\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-multichar"
Do not warn if a multicharacter constant (\fB'\s-1FOOF\s0'\fR) is used.
Usually they indicate a typo in the user's code, as they have
implementation-defined values, and should not be used in portable code.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-deprecated\-declarations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-deprecated-declarations"
Do not warn about uses of functions, variables, and types marked as
deprecated by using the \f(CW\*(C`deprecated\*(C'\fR attribute.
(@pxref{Function Attributes}, \f(CW@pxref\fR{Variable Attributes},
\&\f(CW@pxref\fR{Type Attributes}.)
.IP "\fB\-Wpacked\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpacked"
Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the packed
attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the structure.
Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For
instance, in this code, the variable \f(CW\*(C`f.x\*(C'\fR in \f(CW\*(C`struct bar\*(C'\fR
will be misaligned even though \f(CW\*(C`struct bar\*(C'\fR does not itself
have the packed attribute:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&        struct foo {
\&          int x;
\&          char a, b, c, d;
\&        } __attribute__((packed));
\&        struct bar {
\&          char z;
\&          struct foo f;
\&        };
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-Wpadded\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpadded"
Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align an element
of the structure or to align the whole structure.  Sometimes when this
happens it is possible to rearrange the fields of the structure to
reduce the padding and so make the structure smaller.
.IP "\fB\-Wredundant\-decls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wredundant-decls"
Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope, even in
cases where multiple declaration is valid and changes nothing.
.IP "\fB\-Wnested\-externs\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wnested-externs (C only)"
Warn if an \f(CW\*(C`extern\*(C'\fR declaration is encountered within a function.
.IP "\fB\-Wunreachable\-code\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunreachable-code"
Warn if the compiler detects that code will never be executed.
.Sp
This option is intended to warn when the compiler detects that at
least a whole line of source code will never be executed, because
some condition is never satisfied or because it is after a
procedure that never returns.
.Sp
It is possible for this option to produce a warning even though there
are circumstances under which part of the affected line can be executed,
so care should be taken when removing apparently-unreachable code.
.Sp
For instance, when a function is inlined, a warning may mean that the
line is unreachable in only one inlined copy of the function.
.Sp
This option is not made part of \fB\-Wall\fR because in a debugging
version of a program there is often substantial code which checks
correct functioning of the program and is, hopefully, unreachable
because the program does work.  Another common use of unreachable
code is to provide behavior which is selectable at compile\-time.
.IP "\fB\-Winline\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Winline"
Warn if a function can not be inlined and it was declared as inline.
Even with this option, the compiler will not warn about failures to
inline functions declared in system headers.
.Sp
The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not
to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account
the size of the function being inlined and the the amount of inlining
that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore,
seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the
warnings produced by \fB\-Winline\fR to appear or disappear.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-invalid\-offsetof\fR (\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-invalid-offsetof ( only)"
Suppress warnings from applying the \fBoffsetof\fR macro to a non-POD
type.  According to the 1998 \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ standard, applying \fBoffsetof\fR
to a non-POD type is undefined.  In existing \*(C+ implementations,
however, \fBoffsetof\fR typically gives meaningful results even when
applied to certain kinds of non-POD types. (Such as a simple
\&\fBstruct\fR that fails to be a \s-1POD\s0 type only by virtue of having a
constructor.)  This flag is for users who are aware that they are
writing nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the
warning about it.
.Sp
The restrictions on \fBoffsetof\fR may be relaxed in a future version
of the \*(C+ standard.
.IP "\fB\-Winvalid\-pch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Winvalid-pch"
Warn if a precompiled header is found in
the search path but can't be used.
.IP "\fB\-Wlong\-long\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wlong-long"
Warn if \fBlong long\fR type is used.  This is default.  To inhibit
the warning messages, use \fB\-Wno\-long\-long\fR.  Flags
\&\fB\-Wlong\-long\fR and \fB\-Wno\-long\-long\fR are taken into account
only when \fB\-pedantic\fR flag is used.
.IP "\fB\-Wdisabled\-optimization\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wdisabled-optimization"
Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.  This warning does
not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your code; it
merely indicates that \s-1GCC\s0's optimizers were unable to handle the code
effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code is too big or too
complex; \s-1GCC\s0 will refuse to optimize programs when the optimization
itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of time.
.IP "\fB\-Werror\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Werror"
Make all warnings into errors.
.Sh "Options for Debugging Your Program or \s-1GCC\s0"
.IX Subsection "Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC"
\&\s-1GCC\s0 has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or \s-1GCC:\s0
.IP "\fB\-g\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g"
Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs, \s-1COFF\s0, \s-1XCOFF\s0, or \s-1DWARF\s0).  \s-1GDB\s0 can work with this debugging
information.
.Sp
On most systems that use stabs format, \fB\-g\fR enables use of extra
debugging information that only \s-1GDB\s0 can use; this extra information
makes debugging work better in \s-1GDB\s0 but will probably make other debuggers
crash or
refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether
to generate the extra information, use \fB\-gstabs+\fR, \fB\-gstabs\fR,
\&\fB\-gxcoff+\fR, \fB\-gxcoff\fR, or \fB\-gvms\fR (see below).
.Sp
Unlike most other C compilers, \s-1GCC\s0 allows you to use \fB\-g\fR with
\&\fB\-O\fR.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values were already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they were moved out of loops.
.Sp
Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.
.Sp
The following options are useful when \s-1GCC\s0 is generated with the
capability for more than one debugging format.
.IP "\fB\-ggdb\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ggdb"
Produce debugging information for use by \s-1GDB\s0.  This means to use the
most expressive format available (\s-1DWARF\s0 2, stabs, or the native format
if neither of those are supported), including \s-1GDB\s0 extensions if at all
possible.
.IP "\fB\-gstabs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gstabs"
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
without \s-1GDB\s0 extensions.  This is the format used by \s-1DBX\s0 on most \s-1BSD\s0
systems.  On \s-1MIPS\s0, Alpha and System V Release 4 systems this option
produces stabs debugging output which is not understood by \s-1DBX\s0 or \s-1SDB\s0.
On System V Release 4 systems this option requires the \s-1GNU\s0 assembler.
.IP "\fB\-feliminate\-unused\-debug\-symbols\fR" 4
.IX Item "-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols"
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
for only symbols that are actually used.
.IP "\fB\-gstabs+\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gstabs+"
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
using \s-1GNU\s0 extensions understood only by the \s-1GNU\s0 debugger (\s-1GDB\s0).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program.
.IP "\fB\-gcoff\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gcoff"
Produce debugging information in \s-1COFF\s0 format (if that is supported).
This is the format used by \s-1SDB\s0 on most System V systems prior to
System V Release 4.
.IP "\fB\-gxcoff\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gxcoff"
Produce debugging information in \s-1XCOFF\s0 format (if that is supported).
This is the format used by the \s-1DBX\s0 debugger on \s-1IBM\s0 \s-1RS/6000\s0 systems.
.IP "\fB\-gxcoff+\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gxcoff+"
Produce debugging information in \s-1XCOFF\s0 format (if that is supported),
using \s-1GNU\s0 extensions understood only by the \s-1GNU\s0 debugger (\s-1GDB\s0).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program, and may cause assemblers other than the \s-1GNU\s0
assembler (\s-1GAS\s0) to fail with an error.
.IP "\fB\-gdwarf\-2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gdwarf-2"
Produce debugging information in \s-1DWARF\s0 version 2 format (if that is

Request debugging information and also use \fIlevel\fR to specify how
much information.  The default level is 2.

Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in
parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This includes
descriptions of functions and external variables, but no information
about local variables and no line numbers.
.Sp
Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions
present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when
you use \fB\-g3\fR.

Note that in order to avoid confusion between \s-1DWARF1\s0 debug level 2,
and \s-1DWARF2\s0 \fB\-gdwarf\-2\fR does not accept a concatenated debug

Add code so that program flow \fIarcs\fR are instrumented.  During

profile-directed optimizations (\fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR), or for
test coverage analysis (\fB\-ftest\-coverage\fR). Each object file's
\&\fIauxname\fR is generated from the name of the output file, if
explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is
the basename of the source file. In both cases any suffix is removed
(e.g.  \fIfoo.gcda\fR for input file \fIdir/foo.c\fR, or

.IP "\fB\-d\fR\fIletters\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dletters"
Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified by
\&\fIletters\fR.  This is used for debugging the compiler.  The file names
for most of the dumps are made by appending a pass number and a word to
the \fIdumpname\fR. \fIdumpname\fR is generated from the name of the
output file, if explicitly specified and it is not an executable,
otherwise it is the basename of the source file. In both cases any
suffix is removed (e.g.  \fIfoo.01.rtl\fR or \fIfoo.02.sibling\fR).
Here are the possible letters for use in \fIletters\fR, and their
meanings:

.RS 4
.IP "\fBaddress\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-frandom\-seed=\fR\fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frandom-seed=string"
This option provides a seed that \s-1GCC\s0 uses when it would otherwise use
random numbers.  It is used to generate certain symbol names
that have to be different in every compiled file. It is also used to
place unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files that
produce them. You can use the \fB\-frandom\-seed\fR option to produce
reproducibly identical object files.
.Sp
The \fIstring\fR should be different for every file you compile.
.IP "\fB\-fsched\-verbose=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsched-verbose=n"
On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option controls the
amount of debugging output the scheduler prints.  This information is
written to standard error, unless \fB\-dS\fR or \fB\-dR\fR is
specified, in which case it is output to the usual dump
listing file, \fI.sched\fR or \fI.sched2\fR respectively.  However
for \fIn\fR greater than nine, the output is always printed to standard
error.
.Sp
For \fIn\fR greater than zero, \fB\-fsched\-verbose\fR outputs the
same information as \fB\-dRS\fR.  For \fIn\fR greater than one, it
also output basic block probabilities, detailed ready list information
and unit/insn info.  For \fIn\fR greater than two, it includes \s-1RTL\s0
at abort point, control-flow and regions info.  And for \fIn\fR over
four, \fB\-fsched\-verbose\fR also includes dependence info.
.IP "\fB\-save\-temps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-save-temps"
Store the usual ``temporary'' intermediate files permanently; place them
in the current directory and name them based on the source file.  Thus,
compiling \fIfoo.c\fR with \fB\-c \-save\-temps\fR would produce files
\&\fIfoo.i\fR and \fIfoo.s\fR, as well as \fIfoo.o\fR.  This creates a
preprocessed \fIfoo.i\fR output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.
.IP "\fB\-time\fR" 4
.IX Item "-time"
Report the \s-1CPU\s0 time taken by each subprocess in the compilation
sequence.  For C source files, this is the compiler proper and assembler
(plus the linker if linking is done).  The output looks like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        # cc1 0.12 0.01
\&        # as 0.00 0.01
.Ve
.Sp
The first number on each line is the ``user time,'' that is time spent
executing the program itself.  The second number is ``system time,''
time spent executing operating system routines on behalf of the program.
Both numbers are in seconds.
.IP "\fB\-print\-file\-name=\fR\fIlibrary\fR" 4
.IX Item "-print-file-name=library"
Print the full absolute name of the library file \fIlibrary\fR that
would be used when linking\-\-\-and don't do anything else.  With this
option, \s-1GCC\s0 does not compile or link anything; it just prints the
file name.
.IP "\fB\-print\-multi\-directory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-print-multi-directory"
Print the directory name corresponding to the multilib selected by any
other switches present in the command line.  This directory is supposed
to exist in \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.
.IP "\fB\-print\-multi\-lib\fR" 4
.IX Item "-print-multi-lib"
Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler switches
that enable them.  The directory name is separated from the switches by
\&\fB;\fR, and each switch starts with an \fB@} instead of the
\&\f(CB@samp\fB{\-\fR, without spaces between multiple switches.  This is supposed to
ease shell\-processing.
.IP "\fB\-print\-prog\-name=\fR\fIprogram\fR" 4

.Sp
This is useful when \fBgcc\fR prints the error message
\&\fBinstallation problem, cannot exec cpp0: No such file or directory\fR.
To resolve this you either need to put \fIcpp0\fR and the other compiler
components where \fBgcc\fR expects to find them, or you can set the environment

.IP "\fB\-dumpspecs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dumpspecs"

.IP "\fB\-feliminate\-unused\-debug\-types\fR" 4
.IX Item "-feliminate-unused-debug-types"
Normally, when producing \s-1DWARF2\s0 output, \s-1GCC\s0 will emit debugging
information for all types declared in a compilation
unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used
in that compilation unit.  Sometimes this is useful, such as
if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that is
not actually used in your program (but is declared).  More often,
however, this results in a significant amount of wasted space.
With this option, \s-1GCC\s0 will avoid producing debug symbol output
for types that are nowhere used in the source file being compiled.
.Sh "Options That Control Optimization"
.IX Subsection "Options That Control Optimization"
These options control various sorts of optimizations.
.PP
Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you would expect from the source
code.
.PP
Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.
.PP
The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of
the program.  Using the \fB\-funit\-at\-a\-time\fR flag will allow the
compiler to consider information gained from later functions in the
file when compiling a function.  Compiling multiple files at once to a
single output file (and using \fB\-funit\-at\-a\-time\fR) will allow
the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when
compiling each of them.
.PP
Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed.
.IP "\fB\-O\fR" 4
.IX Item "-O"

Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.
.Sp
With \fB\-O\fR, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of
compilation time.

where doing so does not interfere with debugging.
.IP "\fB\-O2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-O2"
Optimize even more.  \s-1GCC\s0 performs nearly all supported optimizations
that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.  The compiler does not
perform loop unrolling or function inlining when you specify \fB\-O2\fR.
As compared to \fB\-O\fR, this option increases both compilation time
and the performance of the generated code.

If you use multiple \fB\-O\fR options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective.

optimizations to be performed is desired.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-default\-inline\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-default-inline"
Do not make member functions inline by default merely because they are
defined inside the class scope (\*(C+ only).  Otherwise, when you specify
\&\fB\-O\fR, member functions defined inside class scope are compiled
inline by default; i.e., you don't need to add \fBinline\fR in front of
the member function name.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-defer\-pop\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-defer-pop"
Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that function

.IP "\fB\-fforce\-mem\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fforce-mem"
Force memory operands to be copied into registers before doing

.IP "\fB\-fomit\-frame\-pointer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fomit-frame-pointer"
Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
in many functions.  \fBIt also makes debugging impossible on
some machines.\fR
.Sp
On some machines, such as the \s-1VAX\s0, this flag has no effect, because
the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame pointer
and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
machine-description macro \f(CW\*(C`FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED\*(C'\fR controls
whether a target machine supports this flag.

.IP "\fB\-finline\-limit=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finline-limit=n"
By default, \s-1GCC\s0 limits the size of functions that can be inlined.  This flag
allows the control of this limit for functions that are explicitly marked as
inline (i.e., marked with the inline keyword or defined within the class
definition in c++).  \fIn\fR is the size of functions that can be inlined in
number of pseudo instructions (not counting parameter handling).  The default
value of \fIn\fR is 600.
Increasing this value can result in more inlined code at
the cost of compilation time and memory consumption.  Decreasing usually makes
the compilation faster and less code will be inlined (which presumably
means slower programs).  This option is particularly useful for programs that

Allows the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to

optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an

The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called ``type\-punning'') is common.  Even with

Every language that wishes to perform language-specific alias analysis

.IX Item "-ffloat-store"
Do not store floating point variables in registers, and inhibit other
options that might change whether a floating point value is taken from a
register or memory.
.Sp
This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as
the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
precision than a \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does only
good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of \s-1IEEE\s0 floating

.IP "\fB\-fno\-math\-errno\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-math-errno"
Do not set \s-1ERRNO\s0 after calling math functions that are executed

Compile code assuming that floating-point operations cannot generate
user-visible traps.  These traps include division by zero, overflow,
underflow, inexact result and invalid operation.  This option implies
\&\fB\-fno\-signaling\-nans\fR.  Setting this option may allow faster
code if one relies on ``non\-stop'' \s-1IEEE\s0 arithmetic, for example.

.IX Item "-frounding-math"
Disable transformations and optimizations that assume default floating
point rounding behavior.  This is round-to-zero for all floating point
to integer conversions, and round-to-nearest for all other arithmetic
truncations.  This option should be specified for programs that change
the \s-1FP\s0 rounding mode dynamically, or that may be executed with a
non-default rounding mode.  This option disables constant folding of
floating point expressions at compile-time (which may be affected by
rounding mode) and arithmetic transformations that are unsafe in the
presence of sign-dependent rounding modes.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fno\-rounding\-math\fR.

This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee to
disable all \s-1GCC\s0 optimizations that are affected by rounding mode.
Future versions of \s-1GCC\s0 may provide finer control of this setting
using C99's \f(CW\*(C`FENV_ACCESS\*(C'\fR pragma.  This command line option
will be used to specify the default state for \f(CW\*(C`FENV_ACCESS\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fsignaling\-nans\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsignaling-nans"
Compile code assuming that \s-1IEEE\s0 signaling NaNs may generate user-visible

The following options control optimizations that may improve
performance, but are not enabled by any \fB\-O\fR options.  This
section includes experimental options that may produce broken code.
.IP "\fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fbranch-probabilities"
After running a program compiled with \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR, you can compile it a second time using
\&\fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR, to improve optimizations based on
the number of times each branch was taken.  When the program
compiled with \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR exits it saves arc execution
counts to a file called \fI\fIsourcename\fI.gcda\fR for each source
file  The information in this data file is very dependent on the
structure of the generated code, so you must use the same source code
and the same optimization options for both compilations.
.Sp
With \fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 puts a
\&\fB\s-1REG_BR_PROB\s0\fR note on each \fB\s-1JUMP_INSN\s0\fR and \fB\s-1CALL_INSN\s0\fR.
These can be used to improve optimization.  Currently, they are only
used in one place: in \fIreorg.c\fR, instead of guessing which path a
branch is mostly to take, the \fB\s-1REG_BR_PROB\s0\fR values are used to
exactly determine which path is taken more often.
.IP "\fB\-fprofile\-values\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fprofile-values"
If combined with \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR, it adds code so that some
data about values of expressions in the program is gathered.
.Sp
With \fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR, it reads back the data gathered
from profiling values of expressions and adds \fB\s-1REG_VALUE_PROFILE\s0\fR
notes to instructions for their later usage in optimizations.
.IP "\fB\-fvpt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvpt"
If combined with \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR, it instructs the compiler to add
a code to gather information about values of expressions.
.Sp
With \fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR, it reads back the data gathered

Currently the optimizations include specialization of division operation
using the knowledge about the value of the denominator.
.IP "\fB\-fnew\-ra\fR" 4

Use a graph coloring register allocator.  Currently this option is meant
for testing, so we are interested to hear about miscompilations with
\&\fB\-fnew\-ra\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ftracer\fR" 4

Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size. This transformation
simplifies the control flow of the function allowing other optimizations to do
better job.
.IP "\fB\-funit\-at\-a\-time\fR" 4

Parse the whole compilation unit before starting to produce code.
This allows some extra optimizations to take place but consumes more
memory.
.IP "\fB\-funroll\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funroll-loops"
Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time or
upon entry to the loop.  \fB\-funroll\-loops\fR implies
\&\fB\-frerun\-cse\-after\-loop\fR.  It also turns on complete loop peeling
(i.e. complete removal of loops with small constant number of iterations).
This option makes code larger, and may or may not make it run faster.
.IP "\fB\-funroll\-all\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funroll-all-loops"
Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when
the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more slowly.

\&\fB\-funroll\-loops\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fpeel\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpeel-loops"
Peels the loops for that there is enough information that they do not
roll much (from profile feedback).  It also turns on complete loop peeling

Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile
time or upon entry to the loop, using the old loop unroller whose loop
recognition is based on notes from frontend.  \fB\-fold\-unroll\-loops\fR implies
both \fB\-fstrength\-reduce\fR and \fB\-frerun\-cse\-after\-loop\fR.  This

in the output file.
.Sp
Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations
to improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  Most systems
using the \s-1ELF\s0 object format and \s-1SPARC\s0 processors running Solaris 2 have
linkers with such optimizations.  \s-1AIX\s0 may have these optimizations in
the future.
.Sp
Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing
so.  When you specify these options, the assembler and linker will
create larger object and executable files and will also be slower.
You will not be able to use \f(CW\*(C`gprof\*(C'\fR on all systems if you
specify this option and you may have problems with debugging if
you specify both this option and \fB\-g\fR.

.IX Item "-fbranch-target-load-optimize"
Perform branch target register load optimization before prologue / epilogue
threading.
The use of target registers can typically be exposed only during reload,

In some places, \s-1GCC\s0 uses various constants to control the amount of
optimization that is done.  For example, \s-1GCC\s0 will not inline functions
that contain more that a certain number of instructions.  You can
control some of these constants on the command-line using the

\&\fIname\fR are given in the following table:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBmax-crossjump-edges\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-crossjump-edges"
The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for crossjumping.
The algorithm used by \fB\-fcrossjumping\fR is O(N^2) in
the number of edges incoming to each block.  Increasing values mean
more aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with
probably small improvement in executable size.
.IP "\fBmax-delay-slot-insn-search\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-delay-slot-insn-search"
The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an
instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more than this arbitrary number of
instructions is searched, the time savings from filling the delay slot
will be minimal so stop searching.  Increasing values mean more
aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with probably
small improvement in executable run time.
.IP "\fBmax-delay-slot-live-search\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-delay-slot-live-search"
When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to
consider when searching for a block with valid live register
information.  Increasing this arbitrarily chosen value means more
aggressive optimization, increasing the compile time.  This parameter
should be removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the
control-flow graph.
.IP "\fBmax-gcse-memory\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-gcse-memory"

needlessly consume memory and resources.
.IP "\fBmax-inline-insns-single\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-inline-insns-single"
Several parameters control the tree inliner used in gcc.
This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted in \s-1GCC\s0's
internal representation) in a single function that the tree inliner

inline and methods implemented in a class declaration (\*(C+).
The default value is 500.
.IP "\fBmax-inline-insns-auto\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-inline-insns-auto"
When you use \fB\-finline\-functions\fR (included in \fB\-O3\fR),
a lot of functions that would otherwise not be considered for inlining
by the compiler will be investigated.  To those functions, a different
(more restrictive) limit compared to functions declared inline can
be applied.
The default value is 100.
.IP "\fBlarge-function-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-function-insns"
The limit specifying really large functions.  For functions greater than this
limit inlining is constrained by \fB\-\-param large-function-growth\fR.
This parameter is useful primarily to avoid extreme compilation time caused by non-linear

The default value is 600.
.IP "\fBmax-unrolled-insns\fR" 4

.IX Item "tracer-max-code-growth"
Stop tail duplication once code growth has reached given percentage.  This is
rather hokey argument, as most of the duplicates will be eliminated later in

\&\s-1GCC\s0 uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory allocation.  This

Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code
generation.
.Sp
The default is 30% + 70% * (\s-1RAM/1GB\s0) with an upper bound of 100% when
\&\s-1RAM\s0 >= 1GB.  If \f(CW\*(C`getrlimit\*(C'\fR is available, the notion of \*(L"\s-1RAM\s0\*(R" is
the smallest of actual \s-1RAM\s0, \s-1RLIMIT_RSS\s0, \s-1RLIMIT_DATA\s0 and \s-1RLIMIT_AS\s0.  If
\&\s-1GCC\s0 is not able to calculate \s-1RAM\s0 on a particular platform, the lower
bound of 30% is used.  Setting this parameter and

every opportunity.  This is extremely slow, but can be useful for
debugging.
.IP "\fBggc-min-heapsize\fR" 4
.IX Item "ggc-min-heapsize"
Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins bothering

by \fBggc-min-expand\fR% beyond \fBggc-min-heapsize\fR.  Again,
tuning this may improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code
generation.
.Sp
The default is \s-1RAM/8\s0, with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and an
upper bound of 131072 (128 megabytes).  If \f(CW\*(C`getrlimit\*(C'\fR is
available, the notion of \*(L"\s-1RAM\s0\*(R" is the smallest of actual \s-1RAM\s0,
\&\s-1RLIMIT_RSS\s0, \s-1RLIMIT_DATA\s0 and \s-1RLIMIT_AS\s0.  If \s-1GCC\s0 is not able to calculate
\&\s-1RAM\s0 on a particular platform, the lower bound is used.  Setting this
parameter very large effectively disables garbage collection.  Setting
this parameter and \fBggc-min-expand\fR to zero causes a full
collection to occur at every opportunity.
.IP "\fBmax-reload-search-insns\fR" 4

characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.
.Sp
If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write
its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign
(if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you will need
to quote the option.  With \fBsh\fR and \fBcsh\fR,
\&\fB\-D'\fR\fIname\fR\fB(\fR\fIargs...\fR\fB)=\fR\fIdefinition\fR\fB'\fR works.
.Sp
\&\fB\-D\fR and \fB\-U\fR options are processed in the order they
are given on the command line.  All \fB\-imacros\fR \fIfile\fR and
\&\fB\-include\fR \fIfile\fR options are processed after all
\&\fB\-D\fR and \fB\-U\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-U\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-U name"
Cancel any previous definition of \fIname\fR, either built in or
provided with a \fB\-D\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-undef\fR" 4
.IX Item "-undef"
Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The
standard predefined macros remain defined.
.IP "\fB\-I\fR \fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I dir"
Add the directory \fIdir\fR to the list of directories to be searched
for header files.
Directories named by \fB\-I\fR are searched before the standard
system include directories.  If the directory \fIdir\fR is a standard
system include directory, the option is ignored to ensure that the
default search order for system directories and the special treatment
of system headers are not defeated
\&.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o file"
Write output to \fIfile\fR.  This is the same as specifying \fIfile\fR
as the second non-option argument to \fBcpp\fR.  \fBgcc\fR has a
different interpretation of a second non-option argument, so you must
use \fB\-o\fR to specify the output file.
.IP "\fB\-Wall\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wall"
Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for normal code.
At present this is \fB\-Wcomment\fR, \fB\-Wtrigraphs\fR,
\&\fB\-Wmultichar\fR and a warning about integer promotion causing a
change of sign in \f(CW\*(C`#if\*(C'\fR expressions.  Note that many of the
preprocessor's warnings are on by default and have no options to
control them.
.IP "\fB\-Wcomment\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wcomment"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-Wcomments\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wcomments"
.PD
Warn whenever a comment-start sequence \fB/*\fR appears in a \fB/*\fR
comment, or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a \fB//\fR comment.
(Both forms have the same effect.)
.IP "\fB\-Wtrigraphs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wtrigraphs"
@anchor{Wtrigraphs}
Most trigraphs in comments cannot affect the meaning of the program.
However, a trigraph that would form an escaped newline (\fB??/\fR at
the end of a line) can, by changing where the comment begins or ends.
Therefore, only trigraphs that would form escaped newlines produce
warnings inside a comment.
.Sp
This option is implied by \fB\-Wall\fR.  If \fB\-Wall\fR is not
given, this option is still enabled unless trigraphs are enabled.  To
get trigraph conversion without warnings, but get the other
\&\fB\-Wall\fR warnings, use \fB\-trigraphs \-Wall \-Wno\-trigraphs\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wtraditional\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wtraditional"
Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
\&\s-1ISO\s0 C.  Also warn about \s-1ISO\s0 C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and problematic constructs which should be avoided.
.IP "\fB\-Wimport\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wimport"
Warn the first time \fB#import\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-Wundef\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wundef"
Warn whenever an identifier which is not a macro is encountered in an
\&\fB#if\fR directive, outside of \fBdefined\fR.  Such identifiers are
replaced with zero.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-macros\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-macros"
Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A macro
is \fIused\fR if it is expanded or tested for existence at least once.
The preprocessor will also warn if the macro has not been used at the
time it is redefined or undefined.
.Sp
Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros
defined in include files are not warned about.
.Sp
\&\fBNote:\fR If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped
conditional blocks, then \s-1CPP\s0 will report it as unused.  To avoid the
warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the macro's
definition by, for example, moving it into the first skipped block.
Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with something like:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning
\&        #endif
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-Wendif\-labels\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wendif-labels"
Warn whenever an \fB#else\fR or an \fB#endif\fR are followed by text.
This usually happens in code of the form
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        #if FOO
\&        ...
\&        #else FOO
\&        ...
\&        #endif FOO
.Ve
.Sp
The second and third \f(CW\*(C`FOO\*(C'\fR should be in comments, but often are not
in older programs.  This warning is on by default.
.IP "\fB\-Werror\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Werror"
Make all warnings into hard errors.  Source code which triggers warnings
will be rejected.
.IP "\fB\-Wsystem\-headers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsystem-headers"
Issue warnings for code in system headers.  These are normally unhelpful
in finding bugs in your own code, therefore suppressed.  If you are
responsible for the system library, you may want to see them.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR" 4
.IX Item "-w"
Suppress all warnings, including those which \s-1GNU\s0 \s-1CPP\s0 issues by default.
.IP "\fB\-pedantic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic"
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C standard.  Some of
them are left out by default, since they trigger frequently on harmless
code.
.IP "\fB\-pedantic\-errors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic-errors"
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all mandatory diagnostics
into errors.  This includes mandatory diagnostics that \s-1GCC\s0 issues
without \fB\-pedantic\fR but treats as warnings.
.IP "\fB\-M\fR" 4
.IX Item "-M"
Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
suitable for \fBmake\fR describing the dependencies of the main
source file.  The preprocessor outputs one \fBmake\fR rule containing
the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all
the included files, including those coming from \fB\-include\fR or
\&\fB\-imacros\fR command line options.
.Sp
Unless specified explicitly (with \fB\-MT\fR or \fB\-MQ\fR), the
object file name consists of the basename of the source file with any
suffix replaced with object file suffix.  If there are many included
files then the rule is split into several lines using \fB\e\fR\-newline.
The rule has no commands.
.Sp
This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as
\&\fB\-dM\fR.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency
rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
\&\fB\-MF\fR, or use an environment variable like
\&\fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR.  Debug output
will still be sent to the regular output stream as normal.
.Sp
Passing \fB\-M\fR to the driver implies \fB\-E\fR, and suppresses
warnings with an implicit \fB\-w\fR.
.IP "\fB\-MM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MM"
Like \fB\-M\fR but do not mention header files that are found in
system header directories, nor header files that are included,
directly or indirectly, from such a header.
.Sp
This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an
\&\fB#include\fR directive does not in itself determine whether that
header will appear in \fB\-MM\fR dependency output.  This is a
slight change in semantics from \s-1GCC\s0 versions 3.0 and earlier.
.Sp
@anchor{dashMF}
.IP "\fB\-MF\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MF file"
When used with \fB\-M\fR or \fB\-MM\fR, specifies a
file to write the dependencies to.  If no \fB\-MF\fR switch is given
the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would have sent
preprocessed output.
.Sp
When used with the driver options \fB\-MD\fR or \fB\-MMD\fR,
\&\fB\-MF\fR overrides the default dependency output file.
.IP "\fB\-MG\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MG"
In conjunction with an option such as \fB\-M\fR requesting
dependency generation, \fB\-MG\fR assumes missing header files are
generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising
an error.  The dependency filename is taken directly from the
\&\f(CW\*(C`#include\*(C'\fR directive without prepending any path.  \fB\-MG\fR
also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders
this useless.
.Sp
This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.
.IP "\fB\-MP\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MP"
This option instructs \s-1CPP\s0 to add a phony target for each dependency
other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
dummy rules work around errors \fBmake\fR gives if you remove header
files without updating the \fIMakefile\fR to match.
.Sp
This is typical output:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        test.o: test.c test.h
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        test.h:
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-MT\fR \fItarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MT target"
Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By
default \s-1CPP\s0 takes the name of the main input file, including any path,
deletes any file suffix such as \fB.c\fR, and appends the platform's
usual object suffix.  The result is the target.
.Sp
An \fB\-MT\fR option will set the target to be exactly the string you
specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
argument to \fB\-MT\fR, or use multiple \fB\-MT\fR options.
.Sp
For example, \fB\-MT\ '$(objpfx)foo.o'\fR might give
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-MQ\fR \fItarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MQ target"
Same as \fB\-MT\fR, but it quotes any characters which are special to
Make.  \fB\-MQ\ '$(objpfx)foo.o'\fR gives
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
.Ve
.Sp
The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with
\&\fB\-MQ\fR.
.IP "\fB\-MD\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MD"
\&\fB\-MD\fR is equivalent to \fB\-M \-MF\fR \fIfile\fR, except that
\&\fB\-E\fR is not implied.  The driver determines \fIfile\fR based on
whether an \fB\-o\fR option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its
argument but with a suffix of \fI.d\fR, otherwise it take the
basename of the input file and applies a \fI.d\fR suffix.
.Sp
If \fB\-MD\fR is used in conjunction with \fB\-E\fR, any
\&\fB\-o\fR switch is understood to specify the dependency output file
(but \f(CW@pxref\fR{dashMF,,\-MF}), but if used without \fB\-E\fR, each \fB\-o\fR
is understood to specify a target object file.
.Sp
Since \fB\-E\fR is not implied, \fB\-MD\fR can be used to generate
a dependency output file as a side-effect of the compilation process.
.IP "\fB\-MMD\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MMD"
Like \fB\-MD\fR except mention only user header files, not system
\&\-header files.
.IP "\fB\-fpch\-deps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpch-deps"
When using precompiled headers, this flag
will cause the dependency-output flags to also list the files from the
precompiled header's dependencies.  If not specified only the
precompiled header would be listed and not the files that were used to
create it because those files are not consulted when a precompiled
header is used.

Specify the source language: C, \*(C+, Objective\-C, or assembly.  This has
nothing to do with standards conformance or extensions; it merely
selects which base syntax to expect.  If you give none of these options,
cpp will deduce the language from the extension of the source file:
\&\fB.c\fR, \fB.cc\fR, \fB.m\fR, or \fB.S\fR.  Some other common
extensions for \*(C+ and assembly are also recognized.  If cpp does not
recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is the most
generic mode.

Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that will

Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is
like \fB\-C\fR, except that comments contained within macros are
also passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded.
.Sp
In addition to the side-effects of the \fB\-C\fR option, the
\&\fB\-CC\fR option causes all \*(C+\-style comments inside a macro
to be converted to C\-style comments.  This is to prevent later use
of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the remainder of

.IX Item "-trigraphs"
Process trigraph sequences.
These are three-character sequences, all starting with \fB??\fR, that
are defined by \s-1ISO\s0 C to stand for single characters.  For example,
\&\fB??/\fR stands for \fB\e\fR, so \fB'??/n'\fR is a character
constant for a newline.  By default, \s-1GCC\s0 ignores trigraphs, but in
standard-conforming modes it converts them.  See the \fB\-std\fR and
\&\fB\-ansi\fR options.

.Sh "Options for Linking"
.IX Subsection "Options for Linking"
These options come into play when the compiler links object files into
an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is
not doing a link step.
.IP "\fIobject-file-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "object-file-name"
A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as input
to the linker.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-S\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S"
.IP "\fB\-E\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E"
.PD
If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and
object file names should not be used as arguments.  
.IP "\fB\-l\fR\fIlibrary\fR" 4
.IX Item "-llibrary"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-l\fR \fIlibrary\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l library"
.PD
Search the library named \fIlibrary\fR when linking.  (The second
alternative with the library as a separate argument is only for
\&\s-1POSIX\s0 compliance and is not recommended.)
.Sp
It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the
linker searches and processes libraries and object files in the order they
are specified.  Thus, \fBfoo.o \-lz bar.o\fR searches library \fBz\fR
after file \fIfoo.o\fR but before \fIbar.o\fR.  If \fIbar.o\fR refers
to functions in \fBz\fR, those functions may not be loaded.
.Sp
The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
which is actually a file named \fIlib\fIlibrary\fI.a\fR.  The linker
then uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.
.Sp
The directories searched include several standard system directories
plus any that you specify with \fB\-L\fR.
.Sp
Normally the files found this way are library files\-\-\-archive files
whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive file by
scanning through it for members which define symbols that have so far
been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that is found is an
ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual fashion.  The only
difference between using an \fB\-l\fR option and specifying a file name
is that \fB\-l\fR surrounds \fIlibrary\fR with \fBlib\fR and \fB.a\fR
and searches several directories.
.IP "\fB\-lobjc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-lobjc"
You need this special case of the \fB\-l\fR option in order to
link an Objective-C program.
.IP "\fB\-nostartfiles\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nostartfiles"
Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.
The standard system libraries are used normally, unless \fB\-nostdlib\fR
or \fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nodefaultlibs"
Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.
Only the libraries you specify will be passed to the linker.
The standard startup files are used normally, unless \fB\-nostartfiles\fR
is used.  The compiler may generate calls to memcmp, memset, and memcpy
for System V (and \s-1ISO\s0 C) environments or to bcopy and bzero for
\&\s-1BSD\s0 environments.  These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.
.IP "\fB\-nostdlib\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nostdlib"
Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when linking.
No startup files and only the libraries you specify will be passed to
the linker.  The compiler may generate calls to memcmp, memset, and memcpy
for System V (and \s-1ISO\s0 C) environments or to bcopy and bzero for
\&\s-1BSD\s0 environments.  These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.
.Sp
One of the standard libraries bypassed by \fB\-nostdlib\fR and
\&\fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR is \fIlibgcc.a\fR, a library of internal subroutines
that \s-1GCC\s0 uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or special
needs for some languages.
.Sp
In most cases, you need \fIlibgcc.a\fR even when you want to avoid
other standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify \fB\-nostdlib\fR
or \fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR you should usually specify \fB\-lgcc\fR as well.
This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal \s-1GCC\s0
library subroutines.  (For example, \fB_\|_main\fR, used to ensure \*(C+
constructors will be called.)
.IP "\fB\-pie\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pie"
Produce a position independent executable on targets which support it.
For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of options
that were used to generate code (\fB\-fpie\fR, \fB\-fPIE\fR,
or model suboptions) when you specify this option.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s"
Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the executable.
.IP "\fB\-static\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static"
On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking with the shared
libraries.  On other systems, this option has no effect.
.IP "\fB\-shared\fR" 4
.IX Item "-shared"
Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to
form an executable.  Not all systems support this option.  For predictable
results, you must also specify the same set of options that were used to
generate code (\fB\-fpic\fR, \fB\-fPIC\fR, or model suboptions)
when you specify this option.[1]
.IP "\fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-shared-libgcc"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-static\-libgcc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libgcc"
.PD
On systems that provide \fIlibgcc\fR as a shared library, these options
force the use of either the shared or static version respectively.
If no shared version of \fIlibgcc\fR was built when the compiler was
configured, these options have no effect.
.Sp
There are several situations in which an application should use the
shared \fIlibgcc\fR instead of the static version.  The most common
of these is when the application wishes to throw and catch exceptions
across different shared libraries.  In that case, each of the libraries
as well as the application itself should use the shared \fIlibgcc\fR.
.Sp
Therefore, the G++ and \s-1GCJ\s0 drivers automatically add
\&\fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR whenever you build a shared library or a main
executable, because \*(C+ and Java programs typically use exceptions, so
this is the right thing to do.
.Sp
If, instead, you use the \s-1GCC\s0 driver to create shared libraries, you may
find that they will not always be linked with the shared \fIlibgcc\fR.
If \s-1GCC\s0 finds, at its configuration time, that you have a non-GNU linker
or a \s-1GNU\s0 linker that does not support option \fB\-\-eh\-frame\-hdr\fR,
it will link the shared version of \fIlibgcc\fR into shared libraries
by default.  Otherwise, it will take advantage of the linker and optimize
away the linking with the shared version of \fIlibgcc\fR, linking with
the static version of libgcc by default.  This allows exceptions to
propagate through such shared libraries, without incurring relocation
costs at library load time.
.Sp
However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw or catch
exceptions, you must link it using the G++ or \s-1GCJ\s0 driver, as appropriate
for the languages used in the program, or using the option
\&\fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR, such that it is linked with the shared
\&\fIlibgcc\fR.
.IP "\fB\-symbolic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-symbolic"
Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.  Warn
about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the link editor
option \fB\-Xlinker \-z \-Xlinker defs\fR).  Only a few systems support
this option.
.IP "\fB\-Xlinker\fR \fIoption\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Xlinker option"
Pass \fIoption\fR as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
supply system-specific linker options which \s-1GCC\s0 does not know how to
recognize.
.Sp
If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
\&\fB\-Xlinker\fR twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
For example, to pass \fB\-assert definitions\fR, you must write
\&\fB\-Xlinker \-assert \-Xlinker definitions\fR.  It does not work to write
\&\fB\-Xlinker \*(L"\-assert definitions\*(R"\fR, because this passes the entire
string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.
.IP "\fB\-Wl,\fR\fIoption\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wl,option"
Pass \fIoption\fR as an option to the linker.  If \fIoption\fR contains
commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.
.IP "\fB\-u\fR \fIsymbol\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u symbol"
Pretend the symbol \fIsymbol\fR is undefined, to force linking of
library modules to define it.  You can use \fB\-u\fR multiple times with
different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.
.Sh "Options for Directory Search"
.IX Subsection "Options for Directory Search"
These options specify directories to search for header files, for
libraries and for parts of the compiler:
.IP "\fB\-I\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Idir"
Add the directory \fIdir\fR to the head of the list of directories to be
searched for header files.  This can be used to override a system header
file, substituting your own version, since these directories are
searched before the system header file directories.  However, you should
not use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied
system header files (use \fB\-isystem\fR for that).  If you use more than
one \fB\-I\fR option, the directories are scanned in left-to-right
order; the standard system directories come after.
.Sp
If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with
\&\fB\-isystem\fR, is also specified with \fB\-I\fR, the \fB\-I\fR
option will be ignored.  The directory will still be searched but as a
system directory at its normal position in the system include chain.
This is to ensure that \s-1GCC\s0's procedure to fix buggy system headers and
the ordering for the include_next directive are not inadvertently changed.
If you really need to change the search order for system directories,
use the \fB\-nostdinc\fR and/or \fB\-isystem\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-I\-\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I-"
Any directories you specify with \fB\-I\fR options before the \fB\-I\-\fR
option are searched only for the case of \fB#include "\fR\fIfile\fR\fB"\fR;
they are not searched for \fB#include <\fR\fIfile\fR\fB>\fR.
.Sp
If additional directories are specified with \fB\-I\fR options after
the \fB\-I\-\fR, these directories are searched for all \fB#include\fR
directives.  (Ordinarily \fIall\fR \fB\-I\fR directories are used
this way.)
.Sp
In addition, the \fB\-I\-\fR option inhibits the use of the current
directory (where the current input file came from) as the first search
directory for \fB#include "\fR\fIfile\fR\fB"\fR.  There is no way to
override this effect of \fB\-I\-\fR.  With \fB\-I.\fR you can specify
searching the directory which was current when the compiler was
invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor does
by default, but it is often satisfactory.
.Sp
\&\fB\-I\-\fR does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories
for header files.  Thus, \fB\-I\-\fR and \fB\-nostdinc\fR are
independent.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Ldir"
Add directory \fIdir\fR to the list of directories to be searched
for \fB\-l\fR.
.IP "\fB\-B\fR\fIprefix\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Bprefix"
This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
include files, and data files of the compiler itself.
.Sp
The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
\&\fIcpp\fR, \fIcc1\fR, \fIas\fR and \fIld\fR.  It tries
\&\fIprefix\fR as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with and
without \fImachine\fR\fB/\fR\fIversion\fR\fB/\fR.
.Sp
For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
\&\fB\-B\fR prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if \fB\-B\fR
was not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, which are
\&\fI/usr/lib/gcc/\fR and \fI/usr/local/lib/gcc/\fR.  If neither of
those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program
name is searched for using the directories specified in your
\&\fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR environment variable.
.Sp
The compiler will check to see if the path provided by the \fB\-B\fR
refers to a directory, and if necessary it will add a directory
separator character at the end of the path.
.Sp
\&\fB\-B\fR prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
options into \fB\-L\fR options for the linker.  They also apply to
includes files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates these
options into \fB\-isystem\fR options for the preprocessor.  In this case,
the compiler appends \fBinclude\fR to the prefix.
.Sp
The run-time support file \fIlibgcc.a\fR can also be searched for using
the \fB\-B\fR prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left
out of the link if it is not found by those means.
.Sp
Another way to specify a prefix much like the \fB\-B\fR prefix is to use
the environment variable \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.  
.Sp
As a special kludge, if the path provided by \fB\-B\fR is
\&\fI[dir/]stage\fIN\fI/\fR, where \fIN\fR is a number in the range 0 to
9, then it will be replaced by \fI[dir/]include\fR.  This is to help
with boot-strapping the compiler.
.IP "\fB\-specs=\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-specs=file"
Process \fIfile\fR after the compiler reads in the standard \fIspecs\fR
file, in order to override the defaults that the \fIgcc\fR driver
program uses when determining what switches to pass to \fIcc1\fR,
\&\fIcc1plus\fR, \fIas\fR, \fIld\fR, etc.  More than one
\&\fB\-specs=\fR\fIfile\fR can be specified on the command line, and they
are processed in order, from left to right.
.Sh "Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version"
.IX Subsection "Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version"
The usual way to run \s-1GCC\s0 is to run the executable called \fIgcc\fR, or
\&\fI<machine>\-gcc\fR when cross\-compiling, or
\&\fI<machine>\-gcc\-<version>\fR to run a version other than the one that
was installed last.  Sometimes this is inconvenient, so \s-1GCC\s0 provides
options that will switch to another cross-compiler or version.
.IP "\fB\-b\fR \fImachine\fR" 4
.IX Item "-b machine"
The argument \fImachine\fR specifies the target machine for compilation.
.Sp
The value to use for \fImachine\fR is the same as was specified as the
machine type when configuring \s-1GCC\s0 as a cross\-compiler.  For
example, if a cross-compiler was configured with \fBconfigure
i386v\fR, meaning to compile for an 80386 running System V, then you
would specify \fB\-b i386v\fR to run that cross compiler.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR \fIversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V version"
The argument \fIversion\fR specifies which version of \s-1GCC\s0 to run.
This is useful when multiple versions are installed.  For example,
\&\fIversion\fR might be \fB2.0\fR, meaning to run \s-1GCC\s0 version 2.0.
.PP
The \fB\-V\fR and \fB\-b\fR options work by running the
\&\fI<machine>\-gcc\-<version>\fR executable, so there's no real reason to
use them if you can just run that directly.
.Sh "Hardware Models and Configurations"
.IX Subsection "Hardware Models and Configurations"
Earlier we discussed the standard option \fB\-b\fR which chooses among
different installed compilers for completely different target
machines, such as \s-1VAX\s0 vs. 68000 vs. 80386.
.PP
In addition, each of these target machine types can have its own
special options, starting with \fB\-m\fR, to choose among various
hardware models or configurations\-\-\-for example, 68010 vs 68020,
floating coprocessor or none.  A single installed version of the
compiler can compile for any model or configuration, according to the
options specified.
.PP
Some configurations of the compiler also support additional special
options, usually for compatibility with other compilers on the same

\&\fB\-msoft\-float\fR changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile \fIall\fR of a program with

Generate output containing library calls for quad-word (long double)
floating point instructions.  The functions called are those specified
in the \s-1SPARC\s0 \s-1ABI\s0.  This is the default.
.Sp
As of this writing, there are no \s-1SPARC\s0 implementations that have hardware
support for the quad-word floating point instructions.  They all invoke
a trap handler for one of these instructions, and then the trap handler
emulates the effect of the instruction.  Because of the trap handler overhead,
this is much slower than calling the \s-1ABI\s0 library routines.  Thus the

.PD 0

.PD
With \fB\-mflat\fR, the compiler does not generate save/restore instructions
and will use a ``flat'' or single register window calling convention.
This model uses \f(CW%i7\fR as the frame pointer and is compatible with the normal
register window model.  Code from either may be intermixed.
The local registers and the input registers (0\-\-5) are still treated as
``call saved'' registers and will be saved on the stack as necessary.
.Sp
With \fB\-mno\-flat\fR (the default), the compiler emits save/restore

Assume that doubles have 8 byte alignment.  This is the default.
.Sp
With \fB\-munaligned\-doubles\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 assumes that doubles have 8 byte
alignment only if they are contained in another type, or if they have an
absolute address.  Otherwise, it assumes they have 4 byte alignment.
Specifying this option avoids some rare compatibility problems with code
generated by other compilers.  It is not the default because it results
in a performance loss, especially for floating point code.

.IX Item "-mno-faster-structs"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mfaster\-structs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfaster-structs"
.PD
With \fB\-mfaster\-structs\fR, the compiler assumes that structures
should have 8 byte alignment.  This enables the use of pairs of
\&\f(CW\*(C`ldd\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`std\*(C'\fR instructions for copies in structure
assignment, in place of twice as many \f(CW\*(C`ld\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`st\*(C'\fR pairs.
However, the use of this changed alignment directly violates the \s-1SPARC\s0
\&\s-1ABI\s0.  Thus, it's intended only for use on targets where the developer
acknowledges that their resulting code will not be directly in line with
the rules of the \s-1ABI\s0.
.IP "\fB\-mimpure\-text\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mimpure-text"
\&\fB\-mimpure\-text\fR, used in addition to \fB\-shared\fR, tells
the compiler to not pass \fB\-z text\fR to the linker when linking a
shared object.  Using this option, you can link position-dependent
code into a shared object.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mimpure\-text\fR suppresses the ``relocations remain against
allocatable but non-writable sections'' linker error message.
However, the necessary relocations will trigger copy\-on\-write, and the
shared object is not actually shared across processes.  Instead of
using \fB\-mimpure\-text\fR, you should compile all source code with

Generate code that will not trap if the \s-1MMU\s0 has alignment traps enabled.
On \s-1ARM\s0 architectures prior to ARMv4, there were no instructions to
access half-word objects stored in memory.  However, when reading from
memory a feature of the \s-1ARM\s0 architecture allows a word load to be used,
even if the address is unaligned, and the processor core will rotate the
data as it is being loaded.  This option tells the compiler that such
misaligned accesses will cause a \s-1MMU\s0 trap and that it should instead
synthesize the access as a series of byte accesses.  The compiler can
still use word accesses to load half-word data if it knows that the
address is aligned to a word boundary.
.Sp
This option has no effect when compiling for \s-1ARM\s0 architecture 4 or later,
since these processors have instructions to directly access half-word
objects in memory.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-alignment\-traps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-alignment-traps"
Generate code that assumes that the \s-1MMU\s0 will not trap unaligned
accesses.  This produces better code when the target instruction set
does not have half-word memory operations (i.e. implementations prior to
ARMv4).
.Sp
Note that you cannot use this option to access unaligned word objects,
since the processor will only fetch one 32\-bit aligned object from
memory.
.Sp
The default setting is \fB\-malignment\-traps\fR, since this produces
code that will also run on processors implementing \s-1ARM\s0 architecture
version 6 or later.
.Sp
This option is deprecated and will be removed in the next release of \s-1GCC\s0.
.IP "\fB\-mcpu=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcpu=name"
This specifies the name of the target \s-1ARM\s0 processor.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses this name

.IP "\fB\-mtune=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtune=name"
This option is very similar to the \fB\-mcpu=\fR option, except that
instead of specifying the actual target processor type, and hence
restricting which instructions can be used, it specifies that \s-1GCC\s0 should
tune the performance of the code as if the target were of the type
specified in this option, but still choosing the instructions that it
will generate based on the cpu specified by a \fB\-mcpu=\fR option.
For some \s-1ARM\s0 implementations better performance can be obtained by using
this option.
.IP "\fB\-march=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-march=name"
This specifies the name of the target \s-1ARM\s0 architecture.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses this
name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when generating
assembly code.  This option can be used in conjunction with or instead
of the \fB\-mcpu=\fR option.  Permissible names are: \fBarmv2\fR,
\&\fBarmv2a\fR, \fBarmv3\fR, \fBarmv3m\fR, \fBarmv4\fR, \fBarmv4t\fR,

.IX Item "-mfp=number"
.PD
This specifies the version of the floating point emulation available on
the target.  Permissible values are 2 and 3.  \fB\-mfp=\fR is a synonym
for \fB\-mfpe=\fR, for compatibility with older versions of \s-1GCC\s0.
.IP "\fB\-mstructure\-size\-boundary=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mstructure-size-boundary=n"
The size of all structures and unions will be rounded up to a multiple
of the number of bits set by this option.  Permissible values are 8 and
32.  The default value varies for different toolchains.  For the \s-1COFF\s0
targeted toolchain the default value is 8.  Specifying the larger number
can produce faster, more efficient code, but can also increase the size
of the program.  The two values are potentially incompatible.  Code
compiled with one value cannot necessarily expect to work with code or
libraries compiled with the other value, if they exchange information
using structures or unions.
.IP "\fB\-mabort\-on\-noreturn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mabort-on-noreturn"
Generate a call to the function \f(CW\*(C`abort\*(C'\fR at the end of a

.IX Item "-mlong-calls"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-long\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-long-calls"
.PD
Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
address of the function into a register and then performing a subroutine
call on this register.  This switch is needed if the target function
will lie outside of the 64 megabyte addressing range of the offset based
version of subroutine call instruction.
.Sp
Even if this switch is enabled, not all function calls will be turned
into long calls.  The heuristic is that static functions, functions
which have the \fBshort-call\fR attribute, functions that are inside
the scope of a \fB#pragma no_long_calls\fR directive and functions whose
definitions have already been compiled within the current compilation
unit, will not be turned into long calls.  The exception to this rule is
that weak function definitions, functions with the \fBlong-call\fR
attribute or the \fBsection\fR attribute, and functions that are within
the scope of a \fB#pragma long_calls\fR directive, will always be
turned into long calls.
.Sp
This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
\&\fB\-mno\-long\-calls\fR will restore the default behavior, as will
placing the function calls within the scope of a \fB#pragma
long_calls_off\fR directive.  Note these switches have no effect on how
the compiler generates code to handle function calls via function
pointers.

responsible for initializing this register with an appropriate value
before execution begins.
.IP "\fB\-mpic\-register=\fR\fIreg\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-mcirrus\-fix\-invalid\-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcirrus-fix-invalid-insns"
Insert NOPs into the instruction stream to in order to work around
problems with invalid Maverick instruction combinations.  This option
is only valid if the \fB\-mcpu=ep9312\fR option has been used to
enable generation of instructions for the Cirrus Maverick floating
point co\-processor.  This option is not enabled by default, since the
problem is only present in older Maverick implementations.  The default
can be re-enabled by use of the \fB\-mno\-cirrus\-fix\-invalid\-insns\fR

.IP "\fB\-mpoke\-function\-name\fR" 4

.Sp
When performing a stack backtrace, code can inspect the value of
\&\f(CW\*(C`pc\*(C'\fR stored at \f(CW\*(C`fp + 0\*(C'\fR.  If the trace function then looks at
location \f(CW\*(C`pc \- 12\*(C'\fR and the top 8 bits are set, then we know that
there is a function name embedded immediately preceding this location

.IX Item "-mcallee-super-interworking"
Gives all externally visible functions in the file being compiled an \s-1ARM\s0

architecture of the Motorola MPC5xx, MPC6xx, MPC8xx microprocessors, and
the \s-1IBM\s0 4xx microprocessors.
.Sp
Neither architecture is a subset of the other.  However there is a
large common subset of instructions supported by both.  An \s-1MQ\s0
register is included in processors supporting the \s-1POWER\s0 architecture.
.Sp
You use these options to specify which instructions are available on the
processor you are using.  The default value of these options is
determined when configuring \s-1GCC\s0.  Specifying the

options.  We recommend you use the \fB\-mcpu=\fR\fIcpu_type\fR option
rather than the options listed above.
.Sp
The \fB\-mpower\fR option allows \s-1GCC\s0 to generate instructions that
are found only in the \s-1POWER\s0 architecture and to use the \s-1MQ\s0 register.
Specifying \fB\-mpower2\fR implies \fB\-power\fR and also allows \s-1GCC\s0
to generate instructions that are present in the \s-1POWER2\s0 architecture but
not the original \s-1POWER\s0 architecture.

The \fB\-mpowerpc\fR option allows \s-1GCC\s0 to generate instructions that
are found only in the 32\-bit subset of the PowerPC architecture.
Specifying \fB\-mpowerpc\-gpopt\fR implies \fB\-mpowerpc\fR and also allows
\&\s-1GCC\s0 to use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the
General Purpose group, including floating-point square root.  Specifying
\&\fB\-mpowerpc\-gfxopt\fR implies \fB\-mpowerpc\fR and also allows \s-1GCC\s0 to
use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the Graphics

The \fB\-mpowerpc64\fR option allows \s-1GCC\s0 to generate the additional

.PD
Modify generation of the \s-1TOC\s0 (Table Of Contents), which is created for
every executable file.  The \fB\-mfull\-toc\fR option is selected by
default.  In that case, \s-1GCC\s0 will allocate at least one \s-1TOC\s0 entry for
each unique non-automatic variable reference in your program.  \s-1GCC\s0
will also place floating-point constants in the \s-1TOC\s0.  However, only
16,384 entries are available in the \s-1TOC\s0.
.Sp
If you receive a linker error message that saying you have overflowed
the available \s-1TOC\s0 space, you can reduce the amount of \s-1TOC\s0 space used
with the \fB\-mno\-fp\-in\-toc\fR and \fB\-mno\-sum\-in\-toc\fR options.
\&\fB\-mno\-fp\-in\-toc\fR prevents \s-1GCC\s0 from putting floating-point
constants in the \s-1TOC\s0 and \fB\-mno\-sum\-in\-toc\fR forces \s-1GCC\s0 to
generate code to calculate the sum of an address and a constant at
run-time instead of putting that sum into the \s-1TOC\s0.  You may specify one
or both of these options.  Each causes \s-1GCC\s0 to produce very slightly
slower and larger code at the expense of conserving \s-1TOC\s0 space.
.Sp
If you still run out of space in the \s-1TOC\s0 even when you specify both of
these options, specify \fB\-mminimal\-toc\fR instead.  This option causes
\&\s-1GCC\s0 to make only one \s-1TOC\s0 entry for every file.  When you specify this
option, \s-1GCC\s0 will produce code that is slower and larger but which
uses extremely little \s-1TOC\s0 space.  You may wish to use this option
only on files that contain less frequently executed code.

handle an obscure K&R C case of calling a function that takes the
address of its arguments with fewer arguments than declared.  \s-1AIX\s0 \s-1XL\s0
compilers access floating point arguments which do not fit in the
\&\s-1RSA\s0 from the stack when a subroutine is compiled without
optimization.  Because always storing floating-point arguments on the

.IP "\fB\-EB\fR" 4
.IX Item "-EB"
Generate big-endian code.
.IP "\fB\-EL\fR" 4
.IX Item "-EL"
Generate little-endian code.  This is the default for \fBmips*el\-*\-*\fR
configurations.
.IP "\fB\-march=\fR\fIarch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-march=arch"
Generate code that will run on \fIarch\fR, which can be the name of a
generic \s-1MIPS\s0 \s-1ISA\s0, or the name of a particular processor.
The \s-1ISA\s0 names are:
\&\fBmips1\fR, \fBmips2\fR, \fBmips3\fR, \fBmips4\fR,
\&\fBmips32\fR, \fBmips32r2\fR, and \fBmips64\fR.
The processor names are:
\&\fB4kc\fR, \fB4kp\fR, \fB5kc\fR, \fB20kc\fR,
\&\fBm4k\fR,
\&\fBr2000\fR, \fBr3000\fR, \fBr3900\fR, \fBr4000\fR, \fBr4400\fR,
\&\fBr4600\fR, \fBr4650\fR, \fBr6000\fR, \fBr8000\fR, \fBrm7000\fR,
\&\fBrm9000\fR,
\&\fBorion\fR,
\&\fBsb1\fR,
\&\fBvr4100\fR, \fBvr4111\fR, \fBvr4120\fR, \fBvr4300\fR,
\&\fBvr5000\fR, \fBvr5400\fR and \fBvr5500\fR.
The special value \fBfrom-abi\fR selects the
most compatible architecture for the selected \s-1ABI\s0 (that is,
\&\fBmips1\fR for 32\-bit ABIs and \fBmips3\fR for 64\-bit ABIs).
.Sp
In processor names, a final \fB000\fR can be abbreviated as \fBk\fR
(for example, \fB\-march=r2k\fR).  Prefixes are optional, and
\&\fBvr\fR may be written \fBr\fR.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 defines two macros based on the value of this option.  The first
is \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR, which gives the name of target architecture, as
a string.  The second has the form \fB_MIPS_ARCH_\fR\fIfoo\fR,
where \fIfoo\fR is the capitalized value of \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR.
For example, \fB\-march=r2000\fR will set \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR
to \fB\*(L"r2000\*(R"\fR and define the macro \fB_MIPS_ARCH_R2000\fR.
.Sp
Note that the \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR macro uses the processor names given
above.  In other words, it will have the full prefix and will not
abbreviate \fB000\fR as \fBk\fR.  In the case of \fBfrom-abi\fR,
the macro names the resolved architecture (either \fB\*(L"mips1\*(R"\fR or
\&\fB\*(L"mips3\*(R"\fR).  It names the default architecture when no
\&\fB\-march\fR option is given.
.IP "\fB\-mtune=\fR\fIarch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtune=arch"
Optimize for \fIarch\fR.  Among other things, this option controls
the way instructions are scheduled, and the perceived cost of arithmetic
operations.  The list of \fIarch\fR values is the same as for
\&\fB\-march\fR.
.Sp
When this option is not used, \s-1GCC\s0 will optimize for the processor
specified by \fB\-march\fR.  By using \fB\-march\fR and
\&\fB\-mtune\fR together, it is possible to generate code that will
run on a family of processors, but optimize the code for one
particular member of that family.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mtune\fR defines the macros \fB_MIPS_TUNE\fR and
\&\fB_MIPS_TUNE_\fR\fIfoo\fR, which work in the same way as the
\&\fB\-march\fR ones described above.

.PD
Lift (do not lift) the usual restrictions on the size of the global

.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 normally uses a single instruction to load values from the \s-1GOT\s0.
While this is relatively efficient, it will only work if the \s-1GOT\s0
is smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger will cause the linker
to report an error such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        relocation truncated to fit: R_MIPS_GOT16 foobar
.Ve
.Sp
If this happens, you should recompile your code with \fB\-mxgot\fR.
It should then work with very large GOTs, although it will also be
less efficient, since it will take three instructions to fetch the
value of a global symbol.
.Sp
Note that some linkers can create multiple GOTs.  If you have such a
linker, you should only need to use \fB\-mxgot\fR when a single object
file accesses more than 64k's worth of \s-1GOT\s0 entries.  Very few do.
.Sp
These options have no effect unless \s-1GCC\s0 is generating position
independent code.

.IX Item "-mlong32"
Force \f(CW\*(C`long\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR, and pointer types to be 32 bits wide.
.Sp
The default size of \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fRs, \f(CW\*(C`long\*(C'\fRs and pointers depends on
the \s-1ABI\s0.  All the supported ABIs use 32\-bit \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fRs.  The n64 \s-1ABI\s0
uses 64\-bit \f(CW\*(C`long\*(C'\fRs, as does the 64\-bit \s-1EABI\s0; the others use
32\-bit \f(CW\*(C`long\*(C'\fRs.  Pointers are the same size as \f(CW\*(C`long\*(C'\fRs,
or the same size as integer registers, whichever is smaller.

Allocate variables to the read-only data section first if possible, then
next in the small data section if possible, otherwise in data.  This gives

Enable (disable) use of the \f(CW\*(C`%hi()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`%lo()\*(C'\fR assembler
relocation operators.  This option has been superceded by

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-explicit\-relocs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-explicit-relocs"
.PD
Use (do not use) assembler relocation operators when dealing with symbolic
addresses.  The alternative, selected by \fB\-mno\-explicit\-relocs\fR,
is to use assembler macros instead.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mexplicit\-relocs\fR is usually the default if \s-1GCC\s0 was
configured to use an assembler that supports relocation operators.
However, there are two exceptions:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1GCC\s0 is not yet able to generate explicit relocations for the combination
of \fB\-mabi=64\fR and \fB\-mno\-abicalls\fR.  This will be addressed
in a future release.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The combination of \fB\-mabicalls\fR and \fB\-fno\-unit\-at\-a\-time\fR
implies \fB\-mno\-explicit\-relocs\fR unless explicitly overridden.
This is because, when generating abicalls, the choice of relocation
depends on whether a symbol is local or global.  In some rare cases,
\&\s-1GCC\s0 will not be able to decide this until the whole compilation unit
has been read.

These switches control the size of \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR type. The i386
application binary interface specifies the size to be 96 bits,
so \fB\-m96bit\-long\-double\fR is the default in 32 bit mode.
.Sp
Modern architectures (Pentium and newer) would prefer \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR
to be aligned to an 8 or 16 byte boundary.  In arrays or structures
conforming to the \s-1ABI\s0, this would not be possible.  So specifying a
\&\fB\-m128bit\-long\-double\fR will align \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR
to a 16 byte boundary by padding the \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR with an additional
32 bit zero.
.Sp
In the x86\-64 compiler, \fB\-m128bit\-long\-double\fR is the default choice as
its \s-1ABI\s0 specifies that \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR is to be aligned on 16 byte boundary.
.Sp
Notice that neither of these options enable any extra precision over the x87
standard of 80 bits for a \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR.

\&\fBWarning:\fR if you override the default value for your target \s-1ABI\s0, the
structures and arrays containing \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR variables will change
their size as well as function calling convention for function taking
\&\f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR will be modified.  Hence they will not be binary

Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions that
take a fixed number of arguments return with the \f(CW\*(C`ret\*(C'\fR \fInum\fR
instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This saves one
instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop the arguments
there.
.Sp
You can specify that an individual function is called with this calling
sequence with the function attribute \fBstdcall\fR.  You can also
override the \fB\-mrtd\fR option by using the function attribute
\&\fBcdecl\fR.  
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR this calling convention is incompatible with the one
normally used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call
libraries compiled with the Unix compiler.
.Sp
Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
take variable numbers of arguments (including \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR);
otherwise incorrect code will be generated for calls to those
functions.

Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to \fInum\fR
byte boundary.  If \fB\-mpreferred\-stack\-boundary\fR is not specified,
the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128 bits), except when optimizing for code
size (\fB\-Os\fR), in which case the default is the minimum correct
alignment (4 bytes for x86, and 8 bytes for x86\-64).
.Sp
On Pentium and PentiumPro, \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR values
should be aligned to an 8 byte boundary (see \fB\-malign\-double\fR) or
suffer significant run time performance penalties.  On Pentium \s-1III\s0, the
Streaming \s-1SIMD\s0 Extension (\s-1SSE\s0) data type \f(CW\*(C`_\|_m128\*(C'\fR suffers similar
penalties if it is not 16 byte aligned.
.Sp
To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the stack boundary
must be as aligned as that required by any value stored on the stack.
Further, every function must be generated such that it keeps the stack
aligned.  Thus calling a function compiled with a higher preferred
stack boundary from a function compiled with a lower preferred stack
boundary will most likely misalign the stack.  It is recommended that
libraries that use callbacks always use the default setting.
.Sp
This extra alignment does consume extra stack space, and generally
increases code size.  Code that is sensitive to stack space usage, such
as embedded systems and operating system kernels, may want to reduce the
preferred alignment to \fB\-mpreferred\-stack\-boundary=2\fR.

\&\fB\-msoft\-float\fR changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile \fIall\fR of a program with

this to work.

explicitly or implicitly, with the \s-1GNU\s0 linker.  This option does not
have any affect on which ld is called, it only changes what parameters
are passed to that ld.  The ld that is called is determined by the
\&\fB\-\-with\-ld\fR configure option, \s-1GCC\s0's program search path, and
finally by the user's \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  The linker used by \s-1GCC\s0 can be printed

Use \s-1HP\s0 ld specific options.  This passes \fB\-b\fR to ld when building

implicitly, with the \s-1HP\s0 linker.  This option does not have any affect on
which ld is called, it only changes what parameters are passed to that
ld.  The ld that is called is determined by the \fB\-\-with\-ld\fR
configure option, \s-1GCC\s0's program search path, and finally by the user's

.IP "\fB\-mlong\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlong-calls"
Generate code that uses long call sequences.  This ensures that a call
is always able to reach linker generated stubs.  The default is to generate
long calls only when the distance from the call site to the beginning
of the function or translation unit, as the case may be, exceeds a
predefined limit set by the branch type being used.  The limits for
normal calls are 7,600,000 and 240,000 bytes, respectively for the
\&\s-1PA\s0 2.0 and \s-1PA\s0 1.X architectures.  Sibcalls are always limited at
240,000 bytes.
.Sp
Distances are measured from the beginning of functions when using the
\&\fB\-ffunction\-sections\fR option, or when using the \fB\-mgas\fR
and \fB\-mno\-portable\-runtime\fR options together under HP-UX with
the \s-1SOM\s0 linker.
.Sp
It is normally not desirable to use this option as it will degrade
performance.  However, it may be useful in large applications,
particularly when partial linking is used to build the application.
.Sp
The types of long calls used depends on the capabilities of the
assembler and linker, and the type of code being generated.  The
impact on systems that support long absolute calls, and long pic
symbol-difference or pc-relative calls should be relatively small.
However, an indirect call is used on 32\-bit \s-1ELF\s0 systems in pic code
and it is quite long.
.IP "\fB\-nolibdld\fR" 4

Suppress the generation of link options to search libdld.sl when the
\&\fB\-static\fR option is specified on HP-UX 10 and later.
.IP "\fB\-static\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static"
The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc has a dependency on
libdld.sl.  There isn't an archive version of libdld.sl.  Thus,
when the \fB\-static\fR option is specified, special link options
are needed to resolve this dependency.
.Sp
On HP-UX 10 and later, the \s-1GCC\s0 driver adds the necessary options to
link with libdld.sl when the \fB\-static\fR option is specified.
This causes the resulting binary to be dynamic.  On the 64\-bit port,
the linkers generate dynamic binaries by default in any case.  The
\&\fB\-nolibdld\fR option can be used to prevent the \s-1GCC\s0 driver from
adding these link options.

functions in \fIlibgcc.a\fR will be used to perform floating-point
operations.  Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the
floating-point operations, or compiled in such a way as to call such
emulations routines, these routines will issue floating-point
operations.   If you are compiling for an Alpha without floating-point

Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point register set.
\&\fB\-mno\-fp\-regs\fR implies \fB\-msoft\-float\fR.  If the floating-point
register set is not used, floating point operands are passed in integer
registers as if they were integers and floating-point results are passed
in \f(CW$0\fR instead of \f(CW$f0\fR.  This is a non-standard calling sequence,
so any function with a floating-point argument or return value called by code
compiled with \fB\-mno\-fp\-regs\fR must also be compiled with that
option.
.Sp
A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does not use,
and hence need not save and restore, any floating-point registers.
.IP "\fB\-mieee\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mieee"
The Alpha architecture implements floating-point hardware optimized for
maximum performance.  It is mostly compliant with the \s-1IEEE\s0 floating
point standard.  However, for full compliance, software assistance is
required.  This option generates code fully \s-1IEEE\s0 compliant code
\&\fIexcept\fR that the \fIinexact-flag\fR is not maintained (see below).
If this option is turned on, the preprocessor macro \f(CW\*(C`_IEEE_FP\*(C'\fR is
defined during compilation.  The resulting code is less efficient but is
able to correctly support denormalized numbers and exceptional \s-1IEEE\s0
values such as not-a-number and plus/minus infinity.  Other Alpha
compilers call this option \fB\-ieee_with_no_inexact\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mieee\-with\-inexact\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mieee-with-inexact"
This is like \fB\-mieee\fR except the generated code also maintains
the \s-1IEEE\s0 \fIinexact-flag\fR.  Turning on this option causes the
generated code to implement fully-compliant \s-1IEEE\s0 math.  In addition to
\&\f(CW\*(C`_IEEE_FP\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_IEEE_FP_EXACT\*(C'\fR is defined as a preprocessor
macro.  On some Alpha implementations the resulting code may execute
significantly slower than the code generated by default.  Since there is
very little code that depends on the \fIinexact-flag\fR, you should
normally not specify this option.  Other Alpha compilers call this
option \fB\-ieee_with_inexact\fR.

.IP "\fBn\fR" 4

Chopped rounding mode.  Floating point numbers are rounded towards zero.
.IP "\fBd\fR" 4
.IX Item "d"
Dynamic rounding mode.  A field in the floating point control register
(\fIfpcr\fR, see Alpha architecture reference manual) controls the
rounding mode in effect.  The C library initializes this register for
rounding towards plus infinity.  Thus, unless your program modifies the
\&\fIfpcr\fR, \fBd\fR corresponds to round towards plus infinity.

use this option unless you also specify \fB\-mtrap\-precision=i\fR and either
\&\fB\-mfp\-trap\-mode=su\fR or \fB\-mfp\-trap\-mode=sui\fR.  Its only effect
is to emit the line \fB.eflag 48\fR in the function prologue of the
generated assembly file.  Under \s-1DEC\s0 Unix, this has the effect that
IEEE-conformant math library routines will be linked in.
.IP "\fB\-mbuild\-constants\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mbuild-constants"
Normally \s-1GCC\s0 examines a 32\- or 64\-bit integer constant to
see if it can construct it from smaller constants in two or three
instructions.  If it cannot, it will output the constant as a literal and
generate code to load it from the data segment at runtime.
.Sp
Use this option to require \s-1GCC\s0 to construct \fIall\fR integer constants
using code, even if it takes more instructions (the maximum is six).

Older Alpha assemblers provided no way to generate symbol relocations

directly accessed via a single instruction.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-mlarge\-data\fR.  With this option the data area

.PD
Generates code for the big or small memory model.  The small memory
model assumed that all data fits into one 64K word page.  At run-time
the data page (\s-1DP\s0) register must be set to point to the 64K page
containing the .bss and .data program sections.  The big memory model is
the default and requires reloading of the \s-1DP\s0 register for every direct
memory access.
.IP "\fB\-mbk\fR" 4

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-bk\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-mdb\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mdb"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-db\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-db"
.PD
Enable (disable) generation of code using decrement and branch,
DBcond(D), instructions.  This is enabled by default for the C4x.  To be
on the safe side, this is disabled for the C3x, since the maximum
iteration count on the C3x is 2^{23 + 1} (but who iterates loops more than
2^{23} times on the C3x?).  Note that \s-1GCC\s0 will try to reverse a loop so
that it can utilize the decrement and branch instruction, but will give
up if there is more than one memory reference in the loop.  Thus a loop
where the loop counter is decremented can generate slightly more
efficient code, in cases where the \s-1RPTB\s0 instruction cannot be utilized.
.IP "\fB\-mdp\-isr\-reload\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mdp-isr-reload"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mparanoid\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mparanoid"
.PD
Force the \s-1DP\s0 register to be saved on entry to an interrupt service
routine (\s-1ISR\s0), reloaded to point to the data section, and restored on
exit from the \s-1ISR\s0.  This should not be required unless someone has
violated the small memory model by modifying the \s-1DP\s0 register, say within
an object library.
.IP "\fB\-mmpyi\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mmpyi"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-mpyi\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-mpyi"
.PD
For the C3x use the 24\-bit \s-1MPYI\s0 instruction for integer multiplies
instead of a library call to guarantee 32\-bit results.  Note that if one
of the operands is a constant, then the multiplication will be performed
using shifts and adds.  If the \fB\-mmpyi\fR option is not specified for the C3x,
then squaring operations are performed inline instead of a library call.
.IP "\fB\-mfast\-fix\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfast-fix"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-fast\-fix\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-fast-fix"
.PD
The C3x/C4x \s-1FIX\s0 instruction to convert a floating point value to an
integer value chooses the nearest integer less than or equal to the
floating point value rather than to the nearest integer.  Thus if the
floating point number is negative, the result will be incorrectly
truncated an additional code is necessary to detect and correct this
case.  This option can be used to disable generation of the additional
code required to correct the result.
.IP "\fB\-mrptb\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mrptb"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-rptb\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-rptb"
.PD
Enable (disable) generation of repeat block sequences using the \s-1RPTB\s0
instruction for zero overhead looping.  The \s-1RPTB\s0 construct is only used
for innermost loops that do not call functions or jump across the loop
boundaries.  There is no advantage having nested \s-1RPTB\s0 loops due to the
overhead required to save and restore the \s-1RC\s0, \s-1RS\s0, and \s-1RE\s0 registers.
This is enabled by default with \fB\-O2\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mrpts=\fR\fIcount\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mrpts=count"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-rpts\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-rpts"
.PD
Enable (disable) the use of the single instruction repeat instruction
\&\s-1RPTS\s0.  If a repeat block contains a single instruction, and the loop
count can be guaranteed to be less than the value \fIcount\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 will
emit a \s-1RPTS\s0 instruction instead of a \s-1RPTB\s0.  If no value is specified,
then a \s-1RPTS\s0 will be emitted even if the loop count cannot be determined
at compile time.  Note that the repeated instruction following \s-1RPTS\s0 does
not have to be reloaded from memory each iteration, thus freeing up the
\&\s-1CPU\s0 buses for operands.  However, since interrupts are blocked by this
instruction, it is disabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-mloop\-unsigned\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mloop-unsigned"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-loop\-unsigned\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-loop-unsigned"
.PD
The maximum iteration count when using \s-1RPTS\s0 and \s-1RPTB\s0 (and \s-1DB\s0 on the C40)
is 2^{31 + 1} since these instructions test if the iteration count is
negative to terminate the loop.  If the iteration count is unsigned
there is a possibility than the 2^{31 + 1} maximum iteration count may be
exceeded.  This switch allows an unsigned iteration count.
.IP "\fB\-mti\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mti"
Try to emit an assembler syntax that the \s-1TI\s0 assembler (asm30) is happy
with.  This also enforces compatibility with the \s-1API\s0 employed by the \s-1TI\s0
C3x C compiler.  For example, long doubles are passed as structures
rather than in floating point registers.
.IP "\fB\-mregparm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mregparm"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mmemparm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mmemparm"
.PD

Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
take variable numbers of arguments (including \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR);
otherwise incorrect code will be generated for calls to those
functions.
.Sp
In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you call a

.IP "\fB\-mno\-fused\-madd\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-fused-madd"
.PD
Enable or disable use of fused multiply/add and multiply/subtract
instructions in the floating-point option.  This has no effect if the
floating-point option is not also enabled.  Disabling fused multiply/add
and multiply/subtract instructions forces the compiler to use separate
instructions for the multiply and add/subtract operations.  This may be
desirable in some cases where strict \s-1IEEE\s0 754\-compliant results are
required: the fused multiply add/subtract instructions do not round the
intermediate result, thereby producing results with \fImore\fR bits of
precision than specified by the \s-1IEEE\s0 standard.  Disabling fused multiply
add/subtract instructions also ensures that the program output is not
sensitive to the compiler's ability to combine multiply and add/subtract
operations.

.IP "\fB\-mno\-text\-section\-literals\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-text-section-literals"
.PD
Control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is
\&\fB\-mno\-text\-section\-literals\fR, which places literals in a separate
section in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to be placed
in a data \s-1RAM/ROM\s0, and it also allows the linker to combine literal
pools from separate object files to remove redundant literals and
improve code size.  With \fB\-mtext\-section\-literals\fR, the literals
are interspersed in the text section in order to keep them as close as
possible to their references.  This may be necessary for large assembly

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-target\-align\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-target-align"
.PD
When this option is enabled, \s-1GCC\s0 instructs the assembler to
automatically align instructions to reduce branch penalties at the
expense of some code density.  The assembler attempts to widen density
instructions to align branch targets and the instructions following call
instructions.  If there are not enough preceding safe density
instructions to align a target, no widening will be performed.  The
default is \fB\-mtarget\-align\fR.  These options do not affect the
treatment of auto-aligned instructions like \f(CW\*(C`LOOP\*(C'\fR, which the
assembler will always align, either by widening density instructions or
by inserting no-op instructions.
.IP "\fB\-mlongcalls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlongcalls"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-longcalls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-longcalls"
.PD
When this option is enabled, \s-1GCC\s0 instructs the assembler to translate
direct calls to indirect calls unless it can determine that the target
of a direct call is in the range allowed by the call instruction.  This
translation typically occurs for calls to functions in other source
files.  Specifically, the assembler translates a direct \f(CW\*(C`CALL\*(C'\fR
instruction into an \f(CW\*(C`L32R\*(C'\fR followed by a \f(CW\*(C`CALLX\*(C'\fR instruction.
The default is \fB\-mno\-longcalls\fR.  This option should be used in
programs where the call target can potentially be out of range.  This
option is implemented in the assembler, not the compiler, so the
assembly code generated by \s-1GCC\s0 will still show direct call
instructions\-\-\-look at the disassembled object code to see the actual
instructions.  Note that the assembler will use an indirect call for
every cross-file call, not just those that really will be out of range.

.IP "\fB\-fbounds\-check\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fbounds-check"
For front-ends that support it, generate additional code to check that
indices used to access arrays are within the declared range.  This is
currently only supported by the Java and Fortran 77 front\-ends, where
this option defaults to true and false respectively.
.IP "\fB\-ftrapv\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftrapv"
This option generates traps for signed overflow on addition, subtraction,
multiplication operations.
.IP "\fB\-fwrapv\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fwrapv"
This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic
overflow of addition, subtraction and multiplication wraps around
using twos-complement representation.  This flag enables some optimizations
and disables other.  This option is enabled by default for the Java
front\-end, as required by the Java language specification.
.IP "\fB\-fexceptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fexceptions"
Enable exception handling.  Generates extra code needed to propagate
exceptions.  For some targets, this implies \s-1GCC\s0 will generate frame
unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data
size overhead, although it does not affect execution.  If you do not
specify this option, \s-1GCC\s0 will enable it by default for languages like
\&\*(C+ which normally require exception handling, and disable it for
languages like C that do not normally require it.  However, you may need
to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate
properly with exception handlers written in \*(C+.  You may also wish to
disable this option if you are compiling older \*(C+ programs that don't
use exception handling.
.IP "\fB\-fnon\-call\-exceptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fnon-call-exceptions"
Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw exceptions.
Note that this requires platform-specific runtime support that does
not exist everywhere.  Moreover, it only allows \fItrapping\fR
instructions to throw exceptions, i.e. memory references or floating
point instructions.  It does not allow exceptions to be thrown from
arbitrary signal handlers such as \f(CW\*(C`SIGALRM\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-funwind\-tables\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funwind-tables"
Similar to \fB\-fexceptions\fR, except that it will just generate any needed
static data, but will not affect the generated code in any other way.

that needs this handling would enable it on your behalf.
.IP "\fB\-fasynchronous\-unwind\-tables\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fasynchronous-unwind-tables"
Generate unwind table in dwarf2 format, if supported by target machine.  The
table is exact at each instruction boundary, so it can be used for stack
unwinding from asynchronous events (such as debugger or garbage collector).
.IP "\fB\-fpcc\-struct\-return\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpcc-struct-return"
Return ``short'' \f(CW\*(C`struct\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`union\*(C'\fR values in memory like
longer ones, rather than in registers.  This convention is less
efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing intercallability between
GCC-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers, particularly
the Portable C Compiler (pcc).
.Sp
The precise convention for returning structures in memory depends
on the target configuration macros.
.Sp
Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment match
that of some integer type.

\&\fB\-fpcc\-struct\-return\fR.
.Sp
If you specify neither \fB\-fpcc\-struct\-return\fR nor
\&\fB\-freg\-struct\-return\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 defaults to whichever convention is
standard for the target.  If there is no standard convention, \s-1GCC\s0
defaults to \fB\-fpcc\-struct\-return\fR, except on targets where \s-1GCC\s0 is
the principal compiler.  In those cases, we can choose the standard, and
we chose the more efficient register return alternative.

.IP "\fB\-fshared\-data\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fshared-data"
Requests that the data and non\-\f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR variables of this

makes sense only on certain operating systems, where shared data is
shared between processes running the same program, while private data
exists in one copy per process.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-common\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-common"
In C, allocate even uninitialized global variables in the data section of the
object file, rather than generating them as common blocks.  This has the
effect that if the same variable is declared (without \f(CW\*(C`extern\*(C'\fR) in
two different compilations, you will get an error when you link them.
The only reason this might be useful is if you wish to verify that the
program will work on other systems which always work this way.

Don't output a \f(CW\*(C`.size\*(C'\fR assembler directive, or anything else that
would cause trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the

for anything else.
.IP "\fB\-fverbose\-asm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fverbose-asm"
Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to those
who actually need to read the generated assembly code (perhaps while
debugging the compiler itself).
.Sp
\&\fB\-fno\-verbose\-asm\fR, the default, causes the
extra information to be omitted and is useful when comparing two assembler

.IP "\fB\-fpic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpic"
Generate position-independent code (\s-1PIC\s0) suitable for use in a shared
library, if supported for the target machine.  Such code accesses all
constant addresses through a global offset table (\s-1GOT\s0).  The dynamic
loader resolves the \s-1GOT\s0 entries when the program starts (the dynamic
loader is not part of \s-1GCC\s0; it is part of the operating system).  If
the \s-1GOT\s0 size for the linked executable exceeds a machine-specific
maximum size, you get an error message from the linker indicating that
\&\fB\-fpic\fR does not work; in that case, recompile with \fB\-fPIC\fR
instead.  (These maximums are 8k on the \s-1SPARC\s0 and 32k
on the m68k and \s-1RS/6000\s0.  The 386 has no such limit.)
.Sp
Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.  For the 386, \s-1GCC\s0 supports \s-1PIC\s0 for System V
but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the \s-1IBM\s0 \s-1RS/6000\s0 is always
position\-independent.

.IP "\fB\-fpack\-struct\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpack-struct"
Pack all structure members together without holes.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR the \fB\-fpack\-struct\fR switch causes \s-1GCC\s0 to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Additionally, it makes the code suboptimal.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
.IP "\fB\-finstrument\-functions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finstrument-functions"
Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just
after function entry and just before function exit, the following
profiling functions will be called with the address of the current
function and its call site.  (On some platforms,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_builtin_return_address\*(C'\fR does not work beyond the current
function, so the call site information may not be available to the
profiling functions otherwise.)
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn,
\&                                       void *call_site);
\&        void __cyg_profile_func_exit  (void *this_fn,
\&                                       void *call_site);
.Ve
.Sp
The first argument is the address of the start of the current function,
which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.
.Sp
This currently disables function inlining.  This restriction is
expected to be removed in future releases.
.Sp
A function may be given the attribute \f(CW\*(C`no_instrument_function\*(C'\fR, in
which case this instrumentation will not be done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).
.IP "\fB\-fstack\-check\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstack-check"
Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of the
stack.  You should specify this flag if you are running in an
environment with multiple threads, but only rarely need to specify it in
a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is automatically
detected on nearly all systems if there is only one stack.
.Sp
Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be done; the
operating system must do that.  The switch causes generation of code
to ensure that the operating system sees the stack being extended.
.IP "\fB\-fstack\-limit\-register=\fR\fIreg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstack-limit-register=reg"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-fstack\-limit\-symbol=\fR\fIsym\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstack-limit-symbol=sym"
.IP "\fB\-fno\-stack\-limit\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-stack-limit"
.PD
Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond a certain value,
either the value of a register or the address of a symbol.  If the stack
would grow beyond the value, a signal is raised.  For most targets,
the signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so
it is possible to catch the signal without taking special precautions.
.Sp
For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address \fB0x80000000\fR
and grows downwards, you can use the flags
\&\fB\-fstack\-limit\-symbol=_\|_stack_limit\fR and
\&\fB\-Wl,\-\-defsym,_\|_stack_limit=0x7ffe0000\fR to enforce a stack limit
of 128KB.  Note that this may only work with the \s-1GNU\s0 linker.

.IX Item "-fargument-noalias-global"
.PD
Specify the possible relationships among parameters and between
parameters and global data.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fargument\-alias\fR specifies that arguments (parameters) may
alias each other and may alias global storage.\fB\-fargument\-noalias\fR specifies that arguments do not alias
each other, but may alias global storage.\fB\-fargument\-noalias\-global\fR specifies that arguments do not
alias each other and do not alias global storage.
.Sp
Each language will automatically use whatever option is required by
the language standard.  You should not need to use these options yourself.
.IP "\fB\-fleading\-underscore\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fleading-underscore"
This option and its counterpart, \fB\-fno\-leading\-underscore\fR, forcibly
change the way C symbols are represented in the object file.  One use
is to help link with legacy assembly code.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR the \fB\-fleading\-underscore\fR switch causes \s-1GCC\s0 to
generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that
switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
Not all targets provide complete support for this switch.
.IP "\fB\-ftls\-model=\fR\fImodel\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftls-model=model"
Alter the thread-local storage model to be used.
The \fImodel\fR argument should be one of \f(CW\*(C`global\-dynamic\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`local\-dynamic\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`initial\-exec\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`local\-exec\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The default without \fB\-fpic\fR is \f(CW\*(C`initial\-exec\*(C'\fR; with
\&\fB\-fpic\fR the default is \f(CW\*(C`global\-dynamic\*(C'\fR.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
This section describes several environment variables that affect how \s-1GCC\s0
operates.  Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes to use
when searching for various kinds of files.  Some are used to specify other
aspects of the compilation environment.
.PP
Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
\&\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-I\fR and \fB\-L\fR.  These
take precedence over places specified using environment variables, which
in turn take precedence over those specified by the configuration of \s-1GCC\s0.
.IP "\fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LANG"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LC_CTYPE"
.IP "\fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LC_MESSAGES"
.IP "\fB\s-1LC_ALL\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LC_ALL"
.PD
These environment variables control the way that \s-1GCC\s0 uses
localization information that allow \s-1GCC\s0 to work with different
national conventions.  \s-1GCC\s0 inspects the locale categories
\&\fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR if it has been configured to do
so.  These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your
installation.  A typical value is \fBen_GB.UTF\-8\fR for English in the United
Kingdom encoded in \s-1UTF\-8\s0.
.Sp
The \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR environment variable specifies character
classification.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses it to determine the character boundaries in
a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote
and escape characters that would otherwise be interpreted as a string
end or escape.
.Sp
The \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR environment variable specifies the language to
use in diagnostic messages.
.Sp
If the \fB\s-1LC_ALL\s0\fR environment variable is set, it overrides the value
of \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR; otherwise, \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR
and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR default to the value of the \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR
environment variable.  If none of these variables are set, \s-1GCC\s0
defaults to traditional C English behavior.
.IP "\fB\s-1TMPDIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "TMPDIR"
If \fB\s-1TMPDIR\s0\fR is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
files.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
proper.
.IP "\fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "GCC_EXEC_PREFIX"
If \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added
when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can
specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.
.Sp
If \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is not set, \s-1GCC\s0 will attempt to figure out
an appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it was invoked with.
.Sp
If \s-1GCC\s0 cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.
.Sp
The default value of \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is
\&\fI\fIprefix\fI/lib/gcc/\fR where \fIprefix\fR is the value
of \f(CW\*(C`prefix\*(C'\fR when you ran the \fIconfigure\fR script.
.Sp
Other prefixes specified with \fB\-B\fR take precedence over this prefix.
.Sp
This prefix is also used for finding files such as \fIcrt0.o\fR that are
used for linking.
.Sp
In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with \fB/usr/local/lib/gcc\fR
(more precisely, with the value of \fB\s-1GCC_INCLUDE_DIR\s0\fR), \s-1GCC\s0 tries
replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
alternate directory name.  Thus, with \fB\-Bfoo/\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 will search
\&\fIfoo/bar\fR where it would normally search \fI/usr/local/lib/bar\fR.
These alternate directories are searched first; the standard directories
come next.
.IP "\fB\s-1COMPILER_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "COMPILER_PATH"
The value of \fB\s-1COMPILER_PATH\s0\fR is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  \s-1GCC\s0 tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it can't find the
subprograms using \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.
.IP "\fB\s-1LIBRARY_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LIBRARY_PATH"
The value of \fB\s-1LIBRARY_PATH\s0\fR is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  When configured as a native compiler,
\&\s-1GCC\s0 tries the directories thus specified when searching for special
linker files, if it can't find them using \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.  Linking
using \s-1GCC\s0 also uses these directories when searching for ordinary
libraries for the \fB\-l\fR option (but directories specified with
\&\fB\-L\fR come first).
.IP "\fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LANG"
This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.  One way in
which this information is used is to determine the character set to be used
when character literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C and \*(C+.
When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte characters,
the following values for \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR are recognized:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBC\-JIS\fR" 4
.IX Item "C-JIS"
Recognize \s-1JIS\s0 characters.
.IP "\fBC\-SJIS\fR" 4
.IX Item "C-SJIS"
Recognize \s-1SJIS\s0 characters.
.IP "\fBC\-EUCJP\fR" 4
.IX Item "C-EUCJP"
Recognize \s-1EUCJP\s0 characters.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
If \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the
compiler will use mblen and mbtowc as defined by the default locale to
recognize and translate multibyte characters.
.RE
.PP
Some additional environments variables affect the behavior of the
preprocessor.
.IP "\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPATH"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBC_INCLUDE_PATH\fR" 4
.IX Item "C_INCLUDE_PATH"
.IP "\fB\s-1CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
.IP "\fB\s-1OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH"
.PD
Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR, in which to look for header files.
The special character, \f(CW\*(C`PATH_SEPARATOR\*(C'\fR, is target-dependent and
determined at \s-1GCC\s0 build time.  For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with \fB\-I\fR, but after any paths given with \fB\-I\fR
options on the command line.  This environment variable is used
regardless of which language is being preprocessed.
.Sp
The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the
particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of directories
to be searched as if specified with \fB\-isystem\fR, but after any
paths given with \fB\-isystem\fR options on the command line.
.Sp
In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to
search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at the
beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the value of
\&\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR is \f(CW\*(C`:/special/include\*(C'\fR, that has the same
effect as \fB\-I.\ \-I/special/include\fR.
.IP "\fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT"
If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files processed
by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the dependency
output.
.Sp
The value of \fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR can be just a file name, in
which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target
name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form
\&\fIfile\fR\fB \fR\fItarget\fR, in which case the rules are written to
file \fIfile\fR using \fItarget\fR as the target name.
.Sp
In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining
the options \fB\-MM\fR and \fB\-MF\fR,
with an optional \fB\-MT\fR switch too.
.IP "\fB\s-1SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES"
This variable is the same as \fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR (see above),
except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies
\&\fB\-M\fR rather than \fB\-MM\fR.  However, the dependence on the
main input file is omitted.
