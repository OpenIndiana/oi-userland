+This is the GCC used for compiling illumos.
+
+The `il-*` branches contain the the patches used for building illumos, which
+are rebased versions of those used for Solaris/OpenSolaris, and then
+additional changes.  The versions actually in use are tagged with
+`il-VERSION-ilN` where _N_ version the illumos changes over the GCC version in
+question.
+
+The `wip/*` branches are works in progress and _should never be used_
+
+The `codesourcery/*` and `sun/*` branches contain the original GCCs as patched by
+CodeSourcery and Sun Microsystems for use compiling Solaris and OpenSolaris as
+was, and the GCCFSS patches of Sun's
+
+When building the compilers for illumos use the flags generally used are:
+
+i386
+~~~sh
+../../configure --prefix=/opt/gcc/$VER --with-as=/usr/bin/gas --with-gnu-as \
+   --with-ld=/usr/bin/ld --without-gnu-ld --enable-languages="c,c++,objc" \
+   --enable-shared  --with-mpfr-include=/usr/include/mpfr \
+   --with-gmp-include=/usr/include/gmp \
+   --with-pkgversion="Illumos $(git describe --all)" \
+   --with-bugurl="http://github.com/richlowe/gcc/issues"
+~~~

+~~~sh
+../../configure --prefix=/opt/gcc/$VER --without-gnu-as --with-as=/usr/ccs/bin/as" \
+   --with-ld=/usr/bin/ld --without-gnu-ld --enable-languages="c,c++,objc" \

+   --with-pkgversion="Illumos $(git describe --all)" \
+   --with-bugurl="http://github.com/richlowe/gcc/issues"
+~~~
+
+Please use the correct `--with-bugurl` and `--with-pkgversion` flags as
+appropriate for any modifications you make, but please also be sure that they
+accurately describe what is in use (ie, are not left at the defaults) either.
