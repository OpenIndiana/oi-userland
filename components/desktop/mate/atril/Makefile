# tested atril 1.26.0 with epub support and it's still poor.  It
# uses webkitgtk2 for the epubs and can open some, but fails on
# others.  Worse, Atril spawns webkitgtk2 processes for non-epub
# documents too.  Leave epub disabled until that improves, maybe
# with an updated webkitgtk?
CONFIGURE_OPTIONS+=	--disable-epub

# test suite requires a python module called 'dogtail'
# for testing GUI applications which we don't currently package.
