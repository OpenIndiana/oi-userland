IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Run a process in a new container. \fBdocker run\fP starts a process with its own
file system, its own networking, and its own isolated process tree. The IMAGE
which starts the process may define defaults related to the process that will be
run in the container, the networking to expose, and more, but \fBdocker run\fP
gives final control to the operator or administrator who starts the container
from the image. For that reason \fBdocker run\fP has more options than any other
Docker command.

.PP
If the IMAGE is not already loaded then \fBdocker run\fP will pull the IMAGE, and
all image dependencies, from the repository in the same way running \fBdocker
pull\fP IMAGE, before it starts the container from that image.


.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-a\fP, \fB\-\-attach\fP=[]
   Attach to STDIN, STDOUT or STDERR.

.PP
In foreground mode (the default when \fB\-d\fP
is not specified), \fBdocker run\fP can start the process in the container
and attach the console to the process’s standard input, output, and standard
error. It can even pretend to be a TTY (this is what most commandline
executables expect) and pass along signals. The \fB\-a\fP option can be set for
each of stdin, stdout, and stderr.

.PP
\fB\-\-add\-host\fP=[]
   Add a custom host\-to\-IP mapping (host:ip)

.PP
Add a line to /etc/hosts. The format is hostname:ip.  The \fB\-\-add\-host\fP
option can be set multiple times.

.PP
\fB\-\-blkio\-weight\fP=\fI0\fP
   Block IO weight (relative weight) accepts a weight value between 10 and 1000.

.PP
\fB\-\-blkio\-weight\-device\fP=[]
   Block IO weight (relative device weight, format: \fB\fCDEVICE\_NAME:WEIGHT\fR).

.PP
\fB\-\-cpu\-shares\fP=\fI0\fP
   CPU shares (relative weight)

.PP
By default, all containers get the same proportion of CPU cycles. This proportion
can be modified by changing the container's CPU share weighting relative
to the weighting of all other running containers.

.PP
To modify the proportion from the default of 1024, use the \fB\-\-cpu\-shares\fP
flag to set the weighting to 2 or higher.

.PP
The proportion will only apply when CPU\-intensive processes are running.
When tasks in one container are idle, other containers can use the
left\-over CPU time. The actual amount of CPU time will vary depending on
the number of containers running on the system.

.PP
For example, consider three containers, one has a cpu\-share of 1024 and
two others have a cpu\-share setting of 512. When processes in all three
containers attempt to use 100% of CPU, the first container would receive
50% of the total CPU time. If you add a fourth container with a cpu\-share
of 1024, the first container only gets 33% of the CPU. The remaining containers
receive 16.5%, 16.5% and 33% of the CPU.

.PP
On a multi\-core system, the shares of CPU time are distributed over all CPU
cores. Even if a container is limited to less than 100% of CPU time, it can
use 100% of each individual CPU core.

.PP
For example, consider a system with more than three cores. If you start one
container \fB{C0}\fP with \fB\-c=512\fP running one process, and another container
\fB{C1}\fP with \fB\-c=1024\fP running two processes, this can result in the following
division of CPU shares:

.PP
.RS

.nf
PID    container    CPU CPU share
100    {C0}     0   100% of CPU0
101    {C1}     1   100% of CPU1
102    {C1}     2   100% of CPU2

.fi
.RE

.PP
\fB\-\-cap\-add\fP=[]
   Add Linux capabilities

.PP
\fB\-\-cap\-drop\fP=[]
   Drop Linux capabilities

.PP
\fB\-\-cgroup\-parent\fP=""
   Path to cgroups under which the cgroup for the container will be created. If the path is not absolute, the path is considered to be relative to the cgroups path of the init process. Cgroups will be created if they do not already exist.

.PP
\fB\-\-cidfile\fP=""
   Write the container ID to the file

.PP
\fB\-\-cpu\-period\fP=\fI0\fP
   Limit the CPU CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) period

.PP
Limit the container's CPU usage. This flag tell the kernel to restrict the container's CPU usage to the period you specify.

.PP
\fB\-\-cpuset\-cpus\fP=""
   CPUs in which to allow execution (0\-3, 0,1)

.PP
\fB\-\-cpuset\-mems\fP=""
   Memory nodes (MEMs) in which to allow execution (0\-3, 0,1). Only effective on NUMA systems.

.PP
If you have four memory nodes on your system (0\-3), use \fB\fC\-\-cpuset\-mems=0,1\fR
then processes in your Docker container will only use memory from the first
two memory nodes.

.PP
\fB\-\-cpu\-quota\fP=\fI0\fP
   Limit the CPU CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) quota

.PP
Limit the container's CPU usage. By default, containers run with the full
CPU resource. This flag tell the kernel to restrict the container's CPU usage
to the quota you specify.

.PP
\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-detach\fP=\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP
   Detached mode: run the container in the background and print the new container ID. The default is \fIfalse\fP.

.PP
At any time you can run \fBdocker ps\fP in
the other shell to view a list of the running containers. You can reattach to a
detached container with \fBdocker attach\fP. If you choose to run a container in
the detached mode, then you cannot use the \fB\-rm\fP option.

.PP
When attached in the tty mode, you can detach from the container (and leave it
running) using a configurable key sequence. The default sequence is \fB\fCCTRL\-p CTRL\-q\fR.
You configure the key sequence using the \fB\-\-detach\-keys\fP option or a configuration file.
See \fBconfig\-json(5)\fP for documentation on using a configuration file.

.PP
\fB\-\-detach\-keys\fP=""
   Override the key sequence for detaching a container. Format is a single character \fB\fC[a\-Z]\fR or \fB\fCctrl\-<value>\fR where \fB\fC<value>\fR is one of: \fB\fCa\-z\fR, \fB\fC@\fR, \fB\fC^\fR, \fB\fC[\fR, \fB\fC,\fR or \fB\fC\_\fR.

.PP
\fB\-\-device\fP=[]
   Add a host device to the container (e.g. \-\-device=/dev/sdc:/dev/xvdc:rwm)

.PP
\fB\-\-device\-read\-bps\fP=[]
   Limit read rate from a device (e.g. \-\-device\-read\-bps=/dev/sda:1mb)

.PP
\fB\-\-device\-read\-iops\fP=[]
   Limit read rate from a device (e.g. \-\-device\-read\-iops=/dev/sda:1000)

.PP
\fB\-\-device\-write\-bps\fP=[]
   Limit write rate to a device (e.g. \-\-device\-write\-bps=/dev/sda:1mb)

.PP
\fB\-\-device\-write\-iops\fP=[]
   Limit write rate a a device (e.g. \-\-device\-write\-iops=/dev/sda:1000)

.PP
\fB\-\-dns\-search\fP=[]
   Set custom DNS search domains (Use \-\-dns\-search=. if you don't wish to set the search domain)

.PP
\fB\-\-dns\-opt\fP=[]
   Set custom DNS options

.PP
\fB\-\-dns\fP=[]
   Set custom DNS servers

.PP
This option can be used to override the DNS
configuration passed to the container. Typically this is necessary when the
host DNS configuration is invalid for the container (e.g., 127.0.0.1). When this
is the case the \fB\-\-dns\fP flags is necessary for every run.

.PP
\fB\-e\fP, \fB\-\-env\fP=[]
   Set environment variables

.PP
This option allows you to specify arbitrary
environment variables that are available for the process that will be launched
inside of the container.

.PP
\fB\-\-entrypoint\fP=""
   Overwrite the default ENTRYPOINT of the image

.PP
This option allows you to overwrite the default entrypoint of the image that
is set in the Dockerfile. The ENTRYPOINT of an image is similar to a COMMAND
because it specifies what executable to run when the container starts, but it is
(purposely) more difficult to override. The ENTRYPOINT gives a container its
default nature or behavior, so that when you set an ENTRYPOINT you can run the
container as if it were that binary, complete with default options, and you can
pass in more options via the COMMAND. But, sometimes an operator may want to run
something else inside the container, so you can override the default ENTRYPOINT
at runtime by using a \fB\-\-entrypoint\fP and a string to specify the new
ENTRYPOINT.

.PP
\fB\-\-env\-file\fP=[]
   Read in a line delimited file of environment variables

.PP
\fB\-\-expose\fP=[]
   Expose a port, or a range of ports (e.g. \-\-expose=3300\-3310) informs Docker
that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. Docker
uses this information to interconnect containers using links and to set up port
redirection on the host system.

.PP
\fB\-\-group\-add\fP=[]
   Add additional groups to run as

.PP
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-hostname\fP=""
   Container host name

.PP
Sets the container host name that is available inside the container.

.PP
\fB\-\-help\fP
  Print usage statement

.PP
\fB\-i\fP, \fB\-\-interactive\fP=\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP
   Keep STDIN open even if not attached. The default is \fIfalse\fP.

.PP
When set to true, keep stdin open even if not attached. The default is false.

.PP
\fB\-\-ip\fP=""
   Sets the container's interface IPv4 address (e.g. 172.23.0.9)

.PP
It can only be used in conjunction with \fB\-\-net\fP for user\-defined networks

.PP
\fB\-\-ip6\fP=""
   Sets the container's interface IPv6 address (e.g. 2001:db8::1b99)

.PP
It can only be used in conjunction with \fB\-\-net\fP for user\-defined networks

.PP
\fB\-\-ipc\fP=""
   Default is to create a private IPC namespace (POSIX SysV IPC) for the container
                               'container:<name|id>': reuses another container shared memory, semaphores and message queues
                               'host': use the host shared memory,semaphores and message queues inside the container.  Note: the host mode gives the container full access to local shared memory and is therefore considered insecure.

.PP
\fB\-\-isolation\fP="\fIdefault\fP"
   Isolation specifies the type of isolation technology used by containers.

.PP
\fB\-l\fP, \fB\-\-label\fP=[]
   Set metadata on the container (e.g., \-\-label com.example.key=value)

.PP
\fB\-\-kernel\-memory\fP=""
   Kernel memory limit (format: \fB\fC<number>[<unit>]\fR, where unit = b, k, m or g)

.PP
Constrains the kernel memory available to a container. If a limit of 0
is specified (not using \fB\fC\-\-kernel\-memory\fR), the container's kernel memory
is not limited. If you specify a limit, it may be rounded up to a multiple
of the operating system's page size and the value can be very large,
millions of trillions.

.PP
\fB\-\-label\-file\fP=[]
   Read in a line delimited file of labels

.PP
\fB\-\-link\fP=[]
   Add link to another container in the form of <name or id>:alias or just <name or id>
in which case the alias will match the name

.PP
If the operator
uses \fB\-\-link\fP when starting the new client container, then the client
container can access the exposed port via a private networking interface. Docker
will set some environment variables in the client container to help indicate
which interface and port to use.

.PP
\fB\-\-log\-driver\fP="\fIjson\-file\fP|\fIsyslog\fP|\fIjournald\fP|\fIgelf\fP|\fIfluentd\fP|\fIawslogs\fP|\fIsplunk\fP|\fInone\fP"
  Logging driver for container. Default is defined by daemon \fB\fC\-\-log\-driver\fR flag.
  \fBWarning\fP: the \fB\fCdocker logs\fR command works only for the \fB\fCjson\-file\fR and
  \fB\fCjournald\fR logging drivers.

.PP
\fB\-\-log\-opt\fP=[]
  Logging driver specific options.

.PP
\fB\-m\fP, \fB\-\-memory\fP=""
   Memory limit (format: <number>[<unit>], where unit = b, k, m or g)

.PP
Allows you to constrain the memory available to a container. If the host
supports swap memory, then the \fB\-m\fP memory setting can be larger than physical
RAM. If a limit of 0 is specified (not using \fB\-m\fP), the container's memory is
not limited. The actual limit may be rounded up to a multiple of the operating
system's page size (the value would be very large, that's millions of trillions).

.PP
\fB\-\-memory\-reservation\fP=""
   Memory soft limit (format: <number>[<unit>], where unit = b, k, m or g)

.PP
After setting memory reservation, when the system detects memory contention
or low memory, containers are forced to restrict their consumption to their
reservation. So you should always set the value below \fB\-\-memory\fP, otherwise the
hard limit will take precedence. By default, memory reservation will be the same
as memory limit.

.PP
\fB\-\-memory\-swap\fP="LIMIT"
   A limit value equal to memory plus swap. Must be used with the  \fB\-m\fP
(\fB\-\-memory\fP) flag. The swap \fB\fCLIMIT\fR should always be larger than \fB\-m\fP
(\fB\-\-memory\fP) value.

.PP
The format of \fB\fCLIMIT\fR is \fB\fC<number>[<unit>]\fR. Unit can be \fB\fCb\fR (bytes),
\fB\fCk\fR (kilobytes), \fB\fCm\fR (megabytes), or \fB\fCg\fR (gigabytes). If you don't specify a
unit, \fB\fCb\fR is used. Set LIMIT to \fB\fC\-1\fR to enable unlimited swap.

.PP
\fB\-\-mac\-address\fP=""
   Container MAC address (e.g. 92:d0:c6:0a:29:33)

.PP
Remember that the MAC address in an Ethernet network must be unique.
The IPv6 link\-local address will be based on the device's MAC address
according to RFC4862.

.PP
\fB\-\-name\fP=""
   Assign a name to the container

.PP
The operator can identify a container in three ways:
    UUID long identifier (“f78375b1c487e03c9438c729345e54db9d20cfa2ac1fc3494b6eb60872e74778”)
    UUID short identifier (“f78375b1c487”)
    Name (“jonah”)

.PP
The UUID identifiers come from the Docker daemon, and if a name is not assigned
to the container with \fB\-\-name\fP then the daemon will also generate a random
string name. The name is useful when defining links (see \fB\-\-link\fP) (or any
other place you need to identify a container). This works for both background
and foreground Docker containers.

.PP
\fB\-\-net\fP="\fIbridge\fP"
   Set the Network mode for the container
                               'bridge': create a network stack on the default Docker bridge
                               'none': no networking
                               'container:<name|id>': reuse another container's network stack
                               'host': use the Docker host network stack. Note: the host mode gives the container full access to local system services such as D\-bus and is therefore considered insecure.
                               '<network-name>|<network-id>': connect to a user\-defined network

.PP
\fB\-\-net\-alias\fP=[]
   Add network\-scoped alias for the container

.PP
\fB\-\-oom\-kill\-disable\fP=\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP
   Whether to disable OOM Killer for the container or not.

.PP
\fB\-\-oom\-score\-adj\fP=""
   Tune the host's OOM preferences for containers (accepts \-1000 to 1000)

.PP
\fB\-P\fP, \fB\-\-publish\-all\fP=\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP
   Publish all exposed ports to random ports on the host interfaces. The default is \fIfalse\fP.

.PP
When set to true publish all exposed ports to the host interfaces. The
default is false. If the operator uses \-P (or \-p) then Docker will make the
exposed port accessible on the host and the ports will be available to any
client that can reach the host. When using \-P, Docker will bind any exposed
port to a random port on the host within an \fIephemeral port range\fP defined by
\fB\fC/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip\_local\_port\_range\fR. To find the mapping between the host
ports and the exposed ports, use \fB\fCdocker port\fR.

.PP
\fB\-p\fP, \fB\-\-publish\fP=[]
   Publish a container's port, or range of ports, to the host.

.PP
Format: \fB\fCip:hostPort:containerPort | ip::containerPort | hostPort:containerPort | containerPort\fR
Both hostPort and containerPort can be specified as a range of ports.
When specifying ranges for both, the number of container ports in the range must match the number of host ports in the range.
(e.g., \fB\fCdocker run \-p 1234\-1236:1222\-1224 \-\-name thisWorks \-t busybox\fR
but not \fB\fCdocker run \-p 1230\-1236:1230\-1240 \-\-name RangeContainerPortsBiggerThanRangeHostPorts \-t busybox\fR)
With ip: \fB\fCdocker run \-p 127.0.0.1:$HOSTPORT:$CONTAINERPORT \-\-name CONTAINER \-t someimage\fR
Use \fB\fCdocker port\fR to see the actual mapping: \fB\fCdocker port CONTAINER $CONTAINERPORT\fR

.PP
\fB\-\-pid\fP=\fIhost\fP
   Set the PID mode for the container
     \fBhost\fP: use the host's PID namespace inside the container.
     Note: the host mode gives the container full access to local PID and is therefore considered insecure.

.PP
\fB\-\-uts\fP=\fIhost\fP
   Set the UTS mode for the container
     \fBhost\fP: use the host's UTS namespace inside the container.
     Note: the host mode gives the container access to changing the host's hostname and is therefore considered insecure.

.PP
\fB\-\-privileged\fP=\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP
   Give extended privileges to this container. The default is \fIfalse\fP.

.PP
By default, Docker containers are
“unprivileged” (=false) and cannot, for example, run a Docker daemon inside the
Docker container. This is because by default a container is not allowed to
access any devices. A “privileged” container is given access to all devices.

.PP
When the operator executes \fBdocker run \-\-privileged\fP, Docker will enable access
to all devices on the host as well as set some configuration in AppArmor to
allow the container nearly all the same access to the host as processes running
outside of a container on the host.

.PP
\fB\-\-read\-only\fP=\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP
   Mount the container's root filesystem as read only.

.PP
By default a container will have its root filesystem writable allowing processes
to write files anywhere.  By specifying the \fB\fC\-\-read\-only\fR flag the container will have
its root filesystem mounted as read only prohibiting any writes.

.PP
\fB\-\-restart\fP="\fIno\fP"
   Restart policy to apply when a container exits (no, on\-failure[:max\-retry], always, unless\-stopped).

.PP
\fB\-\-rm\fP=\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP
   Automatically remove the container when it exits (incompatible with \-d). The default is \fIfalse\fP.

.PP
\fB\-\-security\-opt\fP=[]
   Security Options

.PP
"label:user:USER"   : Set the label user for the container
    "label:role:ROLE"   : Set the label role for the container
    "label:type:TYPE"   : Set the label type for the container
    "label:level:LEVEL" : Set the label level for the container
    "label:disable"     : Turn off label confinement for the container

.PP
\fB\-\-stop\-signal\fP=\fISIGTERM\fP
  Signal to stop a container. Default is SIGTERM.

.PP
\fB\-\-shm\-size\fP=""
   Size of \fB\fC/dev/shm\fR. The format is \fB\fC<number><unit>\fR.
   \fB\fCnumber\fR must be greater than \fB\fC0\fR.  Unit is optional and can be \fB\fCb\fR (bytes), \fB\fCk\fR (kilobytes), \fB\fCm\fR(megabytes), or \fB\fCg\fR (gigabytes).
   If you omit the unit, the system uses bytes. If you omit the size entirely, the system uses \fB\fC64m\fR.

.PP
\fB\-\-sig\-proxy\fP=\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP
   Proxy received signals to the process (non\-TTY mode only). SIGCHLD, SIGSTOP, and SIGKILL are not proxied. The default is \fItrue\fP.

.PP
\fB\-\-memory\-swappiness\fP=""
   Tune a container's memory swappiness behavior. Accepts an integer between 0 and 100.

.PP
\fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-tty\fP=\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP
   Allocate a pseudo\-TTY. The default is \fIfalse\fP.

.PP
When set to true Docker can allocate a pseudo\-tty and attach to the standard
input of any container. This can be used, for example, to run a throwaway
interactive shell. The default is false.

\fB\-\-tmpfs\fP=[] Create a tmpfs mount

.PP
Mount a temporary filesystem (\fB\fCtmpfs\fR) mount into a container, for example:

.PP
$ docker run \-d \-\-tmpfs /tmp:rw,size=787448k,mode=1777 my\_image

.PP
This command mounts a \fB\fCtmpfs\fR at \fB\fC/tmp\fR within the container.  The supported mount

\fB\-v\fP|\fB\-\-volume\fP[=\fI[[HOST\-DIR:]CONTAINER\-DIR[:OPTIONS]]\fP]
   Create a bind mount. If you specify, \fB\fC\-v /HOST\-DIR:/CONTAINER\-DIR\fR, Docker
   bind mounts \fB\fC/HOST\-DIR\fR in the host to \fB\fC/CONTAINER\-DIR\fR in the Docker
   container. If 'HOST\-DIR' is omitted,  Docker automatically creates the new
   volume on the host.  The \fB\fCOPTIONS\fR are a comma delimited list and can be:
.IP \n+[step]

\item [rw|ro]
\item [z|Z]
\item [\fB\fC[r]shared\fR|\fB\fC[r]slave\fR|\fB\fC[r]private\fR]
.PP
The \fB\fCCONTAINER\-DIR\fR must be an absolute path such as \fB\fC/src/docs\fR. The \fB\fCHOST\-DIR\fR
can be an absolute path or a \fB\fCname\fR value. A \fB\fCname\fR value must start with an
alphanumeric character, followed by \fB\fCa\-z0\-9\fR, \fB\fC\_\fR (underscore), \fB\fC.\fR (period) or
\fB\fC\-\fR (hyphen). An absolute path starts with a \fB\fC/\fR (forward slash).

.PP
If you supply a \fB\fCHOST\-DIR\fR that is an absolute path,  Docker bind\-mounts to the
path you specify. If you supply a \fB\fCname\fR, Docker creates a named volume by that
\fB\fCname\fR. For example, you can specify either \fB\fC/foo\fR or \fB\fCfoo\fR for a \fB\fCHOST\-DIR\fR
value. If you supply the \fB\fC/foo\fR value, Docker creates a bind\-mount. If you
supply the \fB\fCfoo\fR specification, Docker creates a named volume.

.PP
You can specify multiple  \fB\-v\fP options to mount one or more mounts to a
container. To use these same mounts in other containers, specify the
\fB\-\-volumes\-from\fP option also.

.PP
You can add \fB\fC:ro\fR or \fB\fC:rw\fR suffix to a volume to mount it  read\-only or
read\-write mode, respectively. By default, the volumes are mounted read\-write.
See examples.

.PP
Labeling systems like SELinux require that proper labels are placed on volume
content mounted into a container. Without a label, the security system might
prevent the processes running inside the container from using the content. By
default, Docker does not change the labels set by the OS.

.PP
To change a label in the container context, you can add either of two suffixes
\fB\fC:z\fR or \fB\fC:Z\fR to the volume mount. These suffixes tell Docker to relabel file
objects on the shared volumes. The \fB\fCz\fR option tells Docker that two containers
share the volume content. As a result, Docker labels the content with a shared
content label. Shared volume labels allow all containers to read/write content.
The \fB\fCZ\fR option tells Docker to label the content with a private unshared label.
Only the current container can use a private volume.

.PP
By default bind mounted volumes are \fB\fCprivate\fR. That means any mounts done
inside container will not be visible on host and vice\-a\-versa. One can change
this behavior by specifying a volume mount propagation property. Making a
volume \fB\fCshared\fR mounts done under that volume inside container will be
visible on host and vice\-a\-versa. Making a volume \fB\fCslave\fR enables only one
way mount propagation and that is mounts done on host under that volume
will be visible inside container but not the other way around.

.PP
To control mount propagation property of volume one can use \fB\fC:[r]shared\fR,
\fB\fC:[r]slave\fR or \fB\fC:[r]private\fR propagation flag. Propagation property can
be specified only for bind mounted volumes and not for internal volumes or
named volumes. For mount propagation to work source mount point (mount point
where source dir is mounted on) has to have right propagation properties. For
shared volumes, source mount point has to be shared. And for slave volumes,
source mount has to be either shared or slave.

.PP
Use \fB\fCdf <source\-dir>\fR to figure out the source mount and then use
\fB\fCfindmnt \-o TARGET,PROPAGATION <source\-mount\-dir>\fR to figure out propagation
properties of source mount. If \fB\fCfindmnt\fR utility is not available, then one
can look at mount entry for source mount point in \fB\fC/proc/self/mountinfo\fR. Look
at \fB\fCoptional fields\fR and see if any propagaion properties are specified.
\fB\fCshared:X\fR means mount is \fB\fCshared\fR, \fB\fCmaster:X\fR means mount is \fB\fCslave\fR and if
nothing is there that means mount is \fB\fCprivate\fR.

.PP
To change propagation properties of a mount point use \fB\fCmount\fR command. For
example, if one wants to bind mount source directory \fB\fC/foo\fR one can do
\fB\fCmount \-\-bind /foo /foo\fR and \fB\fCmount \-\-make\-private \-\-make\-shared /foo\fR. This
will convert /foo into a \fB\fCshared\fR mount point. Alternatively one can directly
change propagation properties of source mount. Say \fB\fC/\fR is source mount for
\fB\fC/foo\fR, then use \fB\fCmount \-\-make\-shared /\fR to convert \fB\fC/\fR into a \fB\fCshared\fR mount.

.PP
.RS

.PP
\fBNote\fP:
When using systemd to manage the Docker daemon's start and stop, in the systemd
unit file there is an option to control mount propagation for the Docker daemon
itself, called \fB\fCMountFlags\fR. The value of this setting may cause Docker to not
see mount propagation changes made on the mount point. For example, if this value
is \fB\fCslave\fR, you may not be able to use the \fB\fCshared\fR or \fB\fCrshared\fR propagation on
a volume.
.RE

.PP
\fB\-\-volume\-driver\fP=""
   Container's volume driver. This driver creates volumes specified either from
   a Dockerfile's \fB\fCVOLUME\fR instruction or from the \fB\fCdocker run \-v\fR flag.
   See \fBdocker\-volume\-create(1)\fP for full details.

.PP
\fB\-\-volumes\-from\fP=[]
   Mount volumes from the specified container(s)

.PP
Mounts already mounted volumes from a source container onto another
   container. You must supply the source's container\-id. To share
   a volume, use the \fB\-\-volumes\-from\fP option when running
   the target container. You can share volumes even if the source container
   is not running.

.PP
By default, Docker mounts the volumes in the same mode (read\-write or
   read\-only) as it is mounted in the source container. Optionally, you
   can change this by suffixing the container\-id with either the \fB\fC:ro\fR or
   \fB\fC:rw\fR keyword.

.PP
If the location of the volume from the source container overlaps with
   data residing on a target container, then the volume hides
   that data on the target.

.PP
\fB\-w\fP, \fB\-\-workdir\fP=""
   Working directory inside the container

.PP
The default working directory for
running binaries within a container is the root directory (/). The developer can
set a different default with the Dockerfile WORKDIR instruction. The operator
can override the working directory by using the \fB\-w\fP option.

.SH EXAMPLES
.SH Running container in read\-only mode
.PP
During container image development, containers often need to write to the image
content.  Installing packages into /usr, for example.  In production,
applications seldom need to write to the image.  Container applications write
to volumes if they need to write to file systems at all.  Applications can be
made more secure by running them in read\-only mode using the \-\-read\-only switch.
This protects the containers image from modification. Read only containers may
still need to write temporary data.  The best way to handle this is to mount
tmpfs directories on /run and /tmp.

Many applications require the sharing of persistent data across several
containers. Docker allows you to create a Data Volume Container that other

directories so a couple of RUN mkdir instructions might be required for you

When using SELinux, be aware that the host has no knowledge of container SELinux
