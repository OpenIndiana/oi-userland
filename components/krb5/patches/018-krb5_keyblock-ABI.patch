# This provides padding for the krb5_keyblock struct so its size will be the
# same as it was in ON krb to avoid ABI issues that may be caused by the
# difference.  This difference was a result of modifying ON krb to use the
# Crytpo Framework/libpkcs11 API as the crypto provider.  This patch is not
# intended for upstream contribution to MIT.
# Patch source: in-house
