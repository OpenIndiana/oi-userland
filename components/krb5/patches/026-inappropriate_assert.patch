#
# This patch removes an inapropriate assert.
#
# This assert is inappropriate, because the length of the exported name
# object may be smaller than input_name_buffer->value. This has caused
# aborts in RPCSEC_GSS.
#
# This patch is to accomodate Solaris RPC implementation and is not suitable
# upstream contribution.
# Patch source: in-house
