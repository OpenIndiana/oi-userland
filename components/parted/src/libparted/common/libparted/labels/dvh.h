/*
 * Format for volume header information
 *
 * The volume header is a block located at the beginning of all disk
 * media (sector 0).  It contains information pertaining to physical
 * device parameters and logical partition information.
 *
 * The volume header is manipulated by disk formatters/verifiers, 
 * partition builders (e.g. fx, dvhtool, and mkfs), and disk drivers.
 *
 * Previous versions of IRIX wrote a copy of the volume header is
 * located at sector 0 of each track of cylinder 0.  These copies were
 * never used, and reduced the capacity of the volume header to hold large
 * files, so this practice was discontinued.
 * The volume header is constrained to be less than or equal to 512
 * bytes long.  A particular copy is assumed valid if no drive errors
 * are detected, the magic number is correct, and the 32 bit 2's complement
 * of the volume header is correct.  The checksum is calculated by initially
 * zeroing vh_csum, summing the entire structure and then storing the
 * 2's complement of the sum.  Thus a checksum to verify the volume header
 * should be 0.
 *
 * The error summary table, bad sector replacement table, and boot blocks are
 * located by searching the volume directory within the volume header.
 *
 * Tables are sized simply by the integral number of table records that
 * will fit in the space indicated by the directory entry.
 *
 * The amount of space allocated to the volume header, replacement blocks,
 * and other tables is user defined when the device is formatted.
