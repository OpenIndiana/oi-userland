.SH NAME
fixmswrd.pl \- Patches the postscript generated by Microsoft (MS) Word printer drivers so they work with Ghostview 1.5.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfixmswrd\fR [-v] [file [output\-file]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program patches the postscript generated by MS Word printer drivers so they work with Ghostview 1.5.  The problem is that the document structuring conventions are not followed by MS Word.  The pages are supposed to be independent but they depend on a dictionary being opened outside of the pages.  The erroneous structure is modified, and a comment of the following form is added to the document to mark that it has been converted:
.PP
.nf
	%LOCALGhostviewPatched
.fi
