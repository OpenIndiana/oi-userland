Introduction

The X.Org Foundation X Window System distribution is a compilation of code and
documentation from many sources. This document is intended primarily as a guide
to the licenses used in the distribution: you must check each file and/or
package for precise redistribution terms. None-the-less, this summary may be
useful to many users.

This document is based on the compilation from XFree86. If you find any errors
or significant omissions in this document, please contact us with details at <
xorg@lists.freedesktop.org>.

Most of these licenses are based on the MIT, X Consortium, or BSD (original and
revised) licenses. All of them are consistent with the Open Source Definition,
and most are consistent with the Free Software Foundation's Free Software
Definition.

While the current licenses are all open source licenses, the X.Org Foundation
is attempting, over time, to bring as much as possible of the code's licenses
in the distribution into compliance with the Debian Free Software Guidelines.

X.Org Preferred License

The X.Org Foundation has chosen the following format of the MIT License as the
preferred format for code included in the X Window System distribution. This is
a slight variant of the common MIT license form published by the Open Source
Initiative at http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php.
