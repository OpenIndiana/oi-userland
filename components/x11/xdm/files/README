Xdm Default Configuration
-------------------------

The /usr/lib/X11/xdm directory contains a collection of scripts run by 
the default configuration of xdm, and a collection of sample configuration
files.

All of these files will be overwritten by upgrades and should not be
edited in place in /usr/lib/X11/xdm.

The xdm-config file (/etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config unless overridden by the -config
command line option to xdm) specifies the path in which to find the other
configuration files and scripts.

To change a setting in the configuration files (xdm-config, Xaccess, 
Xresources, Xservers), edit the copies in /etc/X11/xdm or create a new
directory for your configuration and copy the appropriate files there.

To change the actions performed by one of the scripts, copy it to your
configuration directory, edit the copy, and then edit the path to it in
the xdm-config file for your configuration.

For more information about the contents of these files, see the xdm(1) 
manual page.
