This directory is only intended for developers willing to rebuild the x11 gate
for testing purposes.

The provided Makefile is fairly basic, it provides targets:
- clobber, to perform gmake clobber in each x11 component directory,
- all, to build, install and publish all the x11 components.

After the component is published successfully a file is created to skip the
directory at next run of gmake all.

Since x11 components have dependencies, there is a need to perform intermediate
installs in the build zone.
This is achieved with pkg update -v --no-backup-be, several requirements apply:
- the user should have at least Software Installation profile,
- the openindiana.org should be temporarily disabled to avoid pulling updates
  during the build,
- the userland publisher should be set as preferred.

For now you should also empty or unlock the X-incorporation to remove version
constraints.
