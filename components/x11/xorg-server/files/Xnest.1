.TH Xnest 1 "24 Jun 2009"
.SH NAME
.PP
Xnest \- a nested X server
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.BR Xnest (1)
X server is no longer included in this release.
.PP
The
.BR Xephyr (1)
and
.BR Xvnc (1)
servers provide similar functionality of acting as an X server to other
clients, and displaying their output in a window on another X server.
.PP
.B Xephyr
acts as a simple X client which is displayed on another X server, while
.B Xvnc
provides a X server which can be connected to from a Remote Frame Buffer (RFB)
protocol client such as
.BR vncviewer (1),
allowing for the session to continue between connections and for connections
to occur from multiple viewing computers.
Both 
.B Xephyr
and
.B Xvnc
offer more support for modern desktop environments and newer X extensions
than the older Xnest server did, and avoid several limitations of the Xnest
server that were due to Xnest's reliance on passing most requests through to
the underlying server.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.IR Xephyr (1),
.IR Xvnc (1),
.IR vncviewer (1),
.IR X11 (5).
