# Modem-related stuff: should reflect modem command interface
# and hardware connection/cabling (e.g. flow control).
#
ModemType:		Class1		# use this to supply a hint

#
# Enabling this will use the hfaxd-protocol to set Caller*ID
#
#ModemSetOriginCmd:	AT+VSID="%s","%d"

#
# If "glare" during initialization becomes a problem then take
# the modem off-hook during initialization, and then place it
# back on-hook when done.
#
#ModemResetCmds:	"ATH1\nAT+VCID=1"	# enables CallID display
#ModemReadyCmds:	ATH0

Class1AdaptRecvCmd:	AT+FAR=1
Class1TMConnectDelay:	400		# counteract quick CONNECT response

#
# If you have trouble with V.17 receiving or sending,
# you may want to enable one of these, respectively.
#
#Class1RMQueryCmd:      "!24,48,72,96"  # enable this to disable V.17 receiving
#Class1TMQueryCmd:      "!24,48,72,96"  # enable this to disable V.17 sending

#
# You'll likely want Caller*ID display (also displays DID) enabled.
#
ModemResetCmds:		AT+VCID=1	# enables CallID display

#
# The pty does not support changing parity.
#
PagerTTYParity:		none

#
# If you are "missing" Caller*ID data on some calls (but not all)
# and if you do not have adequate glare protection you may want to
# not answer based on RINGs, but rather enable the CallIDAnswerLength
# for NDID, disable AT+VCID=1 and do this:
#
#RingsBeforeAnswer: 0
#ModemRingResponse: AT+VRID=1

# Uncomment DATE and TIME if you really want them, but you probably don't.
