 * Fail2ban adds lines like these to /etc/hosts.deny:
 
     sshd: 1.2.3.4
+
+* Solaris IP Filter uses a "last matching rule" algorithm.  If the packet
+  matches a rule containing the "quick" keyword, the action for that rule is
+  taken and no subsequent rules are checked.  This concept is not compatible
+  with fail2ban. It appends rules at the end of a rule set and will never match
+  (i.e. block a connection) if an earlier rule matches (i.e. pass a connection)
+  with quick.  If you want an incoming firewall on a system that only supports
+  incoming web connections, the rules would look like this to support fail2ban:
+
+    block in from any to any
+    pass in from any to any port = 80 keep state
+
+  fail2ban would then append to the end:
+    block in quick from x.x.x.x/32 to any
