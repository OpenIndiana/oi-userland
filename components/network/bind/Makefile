COMPONENT_SUMMARY=	BIND DNS name server and configuration tools.
COMPONENT_DESCRIPTION=	BIND is open source software that implements the Domain Name System \

                        server 'named' and tools used to setup and validate configuration.

# Currently manual pages are distributed from pkg:/system/manual@.
# While there are some changes in our manuals, additions to named(1M) for SMF - that could be fixed
# by a patch.
#
# In addition to BIND deliverables we also deliver SMF files and
# migration notes.  There is no need to install these extras into the
# prototype directory, they are simply referenced in relevant manifest
# (p5m) file.

# If SHELLOPTS is exported (as it is by the userland makefiles),
# then all shell options get exported to child invocations of bash,
# which results in test failures due to nounset and xtrace being
# set unexpectedly, and errors such as "$1: unbound variable" and
# diffs failing due to script tracing in output files.
