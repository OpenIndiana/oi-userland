<p>
This is a TAP driver for Solaris that can be used for 
<a href="http://openvpn.net/">OpenVPN</a>, 
<a href="http://www.infradead.org/openconnect.html">OpenConnect</a>,  
<a href="http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~massar/vpnc/">vpnc</a><br>
The code is based on <a href="http://vtun.sourceforge.net/tun/">
Universal TUN/TAP driver</a>.
I made changes somewhat and added some code to it for supporting Ethernet 
tunneling feature, since Universal TUN/TAP driver for Solaris only supports 
IP tunneling known as TUN. <br><br>
<S>Since there has not been TAP driver for Solaris, OpenVPN does not have code 
for handling a TAP device for Solaris. So I also modified OpenVPN code somewhat, 
and made it work with this TAP driver.<br></S>
OpenVPN patch has been merged into OpenVPN 2.2.0.(2011.04.28).<P>

Also, I wrote bridge moduel for Solaris, so that you can configure Solaris as 
bridge server.

   After extracting tuntap.tar.gz file, run './configure', 'make', and 'make install' as usual.<br>
   Both 'tun' and 'tap' driver will be built and installed on your system. You can access
   these devices through /dev/tun and /dev/tap.

<br>
<li>How to apply
  <br><br>
  <ul>
  <li><b>By replacing file</b>
  <br>
Put tun.c on the directory where you extracted source code of OpenVPN, and swap existing tun.c 
file for it.<br>
Please note that you should rename tun.c.&lt;version&gt; to tun.c file.
  <br>
  <li><b>By patch(1) command</b>
  <br>
If you want to apply patch(1), put patch.openvpn-xxx.tun.c on the directory where you extracted
source code of OpenVPN, and run patch(1) command like as below.<br>
    <pre>
  $ patch -p1 < patch.openvpn-xxxx.tun.c
    </pre>
  </ul>

NOTE: Please download appropriate file which correspond to the version of OpenVPN.<br>
Otherwise, you'll get an error while building a openvpn binary.

<a name="bridge"><h3>Bridge module</h3></a>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kaizawa/bridge/tarball/master">bridge.tar.gz</a> (Last Update: 14 Dec 2009)
<li><a href="http://github.com/kaizawa/bridge">Source</a><p>
 
   After extracting bridge.tar.gz file, run './configure', 'make', and 'make install'. 
   'brdg' and brdgadm will be built and installed on your system.<br>
   Where 'brdg' is a STREAMS module which enables briging 2 interfaces. And where 
   'brdgadm' is a configuration command to add/delete bridge interfaces.

<pre>
Usage: brdgadm [ -a interface | -d interface]
Options:
   -a interface   : Add interface as port
   -d interface   : Delete interface from port list
   -l             : List all interfaces in port list
</pre>

See following sample configuration.

<h4>Network configuration</h4>

<img src="./network_config.png"><br>

HostB is a router which is connected to 2 networks.
By installing TAP and OpenVPN on HostB and HostC,
I try to join HostC to Network1 through OpenVPN.<p>

<ol>
<li> On HostB, install TAP driver and OpenVPN, and then
    configure it as bridging server using server-bridge
    option.
<pre>
-------------
dev tap
proto tcp-server
server-bridge 10.0.0.90 255.0.0.0 10.0.0.10 10.0.0.30
client-to-client
ca /etc/openvpn/keys/ca.crt
cert /etc/openvpn/keys/u1.crt
key /etc/openvpn/keys/u1.key  # This file should be kept secret
dh /etc/openvpn/keys/dh1024.pem
--------------
</pre>
    Then, run openvpn </li>
<li>On HostB, make and install bridge module.
  <ol>
  <li>Extrace bridge.tar.gz
  <pre>
   # gunzip -c bridge.tar.gz | tar xvf -
  </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Make bridge moduel(brdg) and control command(brdgadm)
  <pre>
   # ./configure
   # make
   # make install
  </pre>
  </li>
  </ol> </li>
<li>On HostB, setting up bridge.
  <pre>
   # /usr/local/bin/brdgadm -a tap0
   # /usr/local/bin/brdgadm -a hme1
  </pre>

  where hme1 is a network interface connected with Network1.
  As a result, tap0 and hme1 is bridged.
  At this time, ifconfig looks like as below.
  <pre>
  hme0: flags=1000843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST,IPv4&gt; mtu 1500 index 2
       inet 172.29.73.90 netmask ffffff00 broadcast 172.29.73.255
       ether 8:0:20:91:a6:90
  hme1: flags=1000843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST,IPv4&gt; mtu 1500 index 4
       inet 10.0.0.90 netmask ff000000 broadcast 10.255.255.255
        ether 8:0:20:91:a6:90
  tap0: flags=1000842&lt;BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST,IPv4&gt; mtu 1500 index 5
       inet 0.0.0.0 netmask 0
       ether a:0:20:14:32:52
  </pre></li>

<li>On HostC, install TAP driver and openvpn, and
    configure it as a client.
   <pre>
------------
remote HostB
proto tcp-client
dev tap
client
persist-tun
ca /etc/openvpn/keys/ca.crt
cert /etc/openvpn/keys/onnv01.crt
key /etc/openvpn/keys/onnv01.key
-----------
   </pre>
   Then, run openvpn.
   At this time, ifconfig on HostC looks like as below.

   <pre>
   hme0: flags=1000843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST,IPv4&gt; mtu 1500 index 2
        inet 172.29.73.55 netmask ffffff00 broadcast 172.29.73.255
        ether 8:0:20:c6:69:c7
   tap0: flags=1000843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST,IPv4&gt; mtu 1500 index 4
        inet 10.0.0.10 netmask ff000000 broadcast 10.255.255.255
        ether a:0:20:53:71:52
   </pre></li>
</ol>

Now, HostC joins Network1 via tap0 interface through openvpn.<P>
<b>But, please note that there's some limitation.. HostC can't communicate with
HostB using a bridged IP address on HostB.</b>
I mean, ping 10.0.0.90 on HostC won't work. <p>

<img src="./brdg_issue_en.png">

<ol>
<li>Ethernet packet from OpenVPN headed to HostB is passed to TAP driver.
<li>TAP driver forwards packet to bridge module.
<li>Bridge module forwards packet to hme driver as RAW data.
<li>hme driver transfer the packet to the wire, but never forward it to IP module.
</ol><p>

Of course, HostC can communicate with all the other hosts on Network1, but.. it can't 
communicate with bridged IP address of bridge server.<p>

One more note. Once openvpn running on HostB is terminated,
bridge setting will be invalidated. So, after executing
2nd openvpn on HostB, you need to re-setup the bridge again.<p>

  First, you need to drop existing settings.
  <pre>
   # /usr/local/bin/brdgadm -d hme1
   # /usr/local/bin/brdgadm -d tap0
  </pre>
  Then, re-setup bridge.
  <pre>
   # /usr/local/bin/brdgadm -a hme1
   # /usr/local/bin/brdgadm -a tap0 
  </pre>
</ul>

<a name="tunctl"><h3>tunctl command for Solaris</h3></a>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kaizawa/tunctl/tarball/master">tunctl.tar.gz (v0.1.0)</a> (Last Update: 27th Nov 2011)
<li><a href="http://github.com/kaizawa/tunctl">Source</a><p>
  This is a Solaris version of tunctl command which was originally written by Jeff Dike.<br>
  The tunctl command enables administrator to preconfigure a TUN/TAP device. 
  This command would be useful for testing, or for those who wants to use  
  tun/tap interface just as a virtual interface.<br><br>

  After extracting tuncntl.tar.gz file, run './configure', 'make', and 'make install'.<br>
  By default, tunctl command is installed in /usr/local/bin<br><br>

  NOTE:<br>
  This Solaris version of tunctl command doesn't support the -u option, 
   which enables administrator to specify an user who can use the interface.<br><br>

  Example)<br>
  Create tap0 interface
<pre>
   # /usr/local/bin/tunctl -t tap0
   Set 'tap0' persistent
   #
</pre>
  Delete tap0 interface
<pre>
   # /usr/local/bin/tunctl -d tap0
   #
</pre>
</pre>

<a name="change"><h3>Change log</h3></a>

<ul>
<li>05/08/2006<br>
	<ul>
	<li>Modified tun_unitdata_req() to work on x86 Solaris 9
	</ul>
<li>05/12/2006<br>
	<ul>
	<li>Added tun_generate_mac_addr() to generate MAC address for tap device.
	</ul>
<li>10/09/2006<br>
	<ul>
	<li>Confirmed that the driver was able to work with OpenVPN 2.0.9.<br>
            And also confirmed that tun.c file included in OpenVPN 2.0.9 has not 
            been changed. <br>
	    So the above tun.c file can be compiled with OpenVPN 2.0.9 as well.
	</ul>
<li>11/05/2006<br>
	<ul>
	<li>In tun_ioctl() of tap driver, reverted to original TUN/TAP driver's 
            code which retrieves ppa from user program.
	<li>In open_tun() of openvpn, changed it to use I_STR ioctl command to 
            pass ppa to tap driver. <br>
            This will allow openvpn to specify instance number using 'dev' option, like 
            "dev tap7".
