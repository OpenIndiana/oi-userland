+.Bk -words
+.Op Fl ehR

+.Op Fl l Ar log_level
+.Op Fl P Ar blacklisted_requests
+.Op Fl p Ar whitelisted_requests
+.Op Fl u Ar umask
+.Ek
+.Nm
+.Fl Q Ar protocol_feature
+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+.Nm
+is a program that speaks the server side of SFTP protocol
+to stdout and expects client requests from stdin.
+.Nm
+is not intended to be called directly, but from
+.Xr sshd 1M
+using the
+.Cm Subsystem
+option.
+.Pp
+Command-line flags to
+.Nm
+should be specified in the
+.Cm Subsystem
+declaration.
+See
+.Xr sshd_config 4
+for more information.
+.Pp
+Valid options are:
+.Bl -tag -width Ds
+.It Fl d Ar start_directory
+specifies an alternate starting directory for users.
+The pathname may contain the following tokens that are expanded at runtime:
+%% is replaced by a literal '%',
+%d is replaced by the home directory of the user being authenticated,
+and %u is replaced by the username of that user.
+The default is to use the user's home directory.
+This option is useful in conjunction with the
+.Xr sshd_config 4
+.Cm ChrootDirectory
+option.
+.It Fl e
+Causes
+.Nm
+to print logging information to stderr instead of syslog for debugging.
+.It Fl f Ar log_facility
+Specifies the facility code that is used when logging messages from
+.Nm .
+The possible values are: DAEMON, USER, AUTH, LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2,
+LOCAL3, LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7.
+The default is AUTH.
+.It Fl h
+Displays
+.Nm
+usage information.
+.It Fl l Ar log_level
+Specifies which messages will be logged by
+.Nm .
+The possible values are:
+QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3.
+INFO and VERBOSE log transactions that
+.Nm
+performs on behalf of the client.
+DEBUG and DEBUG1 are equivalent.
+DEBUG2 and DEBUG3 each specify higher levels of debugging output.
+The default is ERROR.
+.It Fl P Ar blacklisted_requests
+Specify a comma-separated list of SFTP protocol requests that are banned by
+the server.
+.Nm
+will reply to any blacklisted request with a failure.
+The
+.Fl Q
+flag can be used to determine the supported request types.
+If both a blacklist and a whitelist are specified, then the blacklist is
+applied before the whitelist.
+.It Fl p Ar whitelisted_requests
+Specify a comma-separated list of SFTP protocol requests that are permitted
+by the server.
+All request types that are not on the whitelist will be logged and replied
+to with a failure message.
+.Pp
+Care must be taken when using this feature to ensure that requests made
+implicitly by SFTP clients are permitted.
+.It Fl Q Ar protocol_feature
+Query protocol features supported by
+.Nm .
+At present the only feature that may be queried is
+.Dq requests ,
+which may be used for black or whitelisting (flags
+.Fl P
+and
+.Fl p
+respectively).
+.It Fl R
+Places this instance of
+.Nm
+into a read-only mode.
+Attempts to open files for writing, as well as other operations that change
+the state of the filesystem, will be denied.
+.It Fl u Ar umask
+Sets an explicit
+.Xr umask 2
+to be applied to newly-created files and directories, instead of the
+user's default mask.
+.El
+.Pp
+On some systems,
+.Nm
+must be able to access
+.Pa /dev/log
+for logging to work, and use of
+.Nm
+in a chroot configuration therefore requires that
+.Xr syslogd 8
+establish a logging socket inside the chroot directory.

-.Op Fl P Ar blacklisted_requests

-.Op Fl u Ar umask

-.Nm
-.Fl Q Ar protocol_feature
-.Sh DESCRIPTION
-.Nm
-is a program that speaks the server side of SFTP protocol
-to stdout and expects client requests from stdin.
-.Nm
-is not intended to be called directly, but from
-.Xr sshd 8
-using the
-.Cm Subsystem
-option.
-.Pp
-Command-line flags to
-.Nm
-should be specified in the
-.Cm Subsystem
-declaration.
-See
-.Xr sshd_config 5
-for more information.
-.Pp
-Valid options are:
-.Bl -tag -width Ds
-.It Fl d Ar start_directory
-specifies an alternate starting directory for users.
-The pathname may contain the following tokens that are expanded at runtime:
-%% is replaced by a literal '%',
-%d is replaced by the home directory of the user being authenticated,
-and %u is replaced by the username of that user.
-The default is to use the user's home directory.
-This option is useful in conjunction with the
-.Xr sshd_config 5
-.Cm ChrootDirectory
-option.
-.It Fl e
-Causes
-.Nm
-to print logging information to stderr instead of syslog for debugging.
-.It Fl f Ar log_facility
-Specifies the facility code that is used when logging messages from
-.Nm .
-The possible values are: DAEMON, USER, AUTH, LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2,
-LOCAL3, LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7.
-The default is AUTH.
-.It Fl h
-Displays
-.Nm
-usage information.
-.It Fl l Ar log_level
-Specifies which messages will be logged by
-.Nm .
-The possible values are:
-QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3.
-INFO and VERBOSE log transactions that
-.Nm
-performs on behalf of the client.
-DEBUG and DEBUG1 are equivalent.
-DEBUG2 and DEBUG3 each specify higher levels of debugging output.
-The default is ERROR.
-.It Fl P Ar blacklisted_requests
-Specify a comma-separated list of SFTP protocol requests that are banned by
-the server.
-.Nm
-will reply to any blacklisted request with a failure.
-The
-.Fl Q
-flag can be used to determine the supported request types.
-If both a blacklist and a whitelist are specified, then the blacklist is
-applied before the whitelist.
-.It Fl p Ar whitelisted_requests
-Specify a comma-separated list of SFTP protocol requests that are permitted
-by the server.
-All request types that are not on the whitelist will be logged and replied
-to with a failure message.
-.Pp
-Care must be taken when using this feature to ensure that requests made
-implicitly by SFTP clients are permitted.
-.It Fl Q Ar protocol_feature
-Query protocol features supported by
-.Nm .
-At present the only feature that may be queried is
-.Dq requests ,
-which may be used for black or whitelisting (flags
-.Fl P
-and
-.Fl p
-respectively).
-.It Fl R
-Places this instance of
-.Nm
-into a read-only mode.
-Attempts to open files for writing, as well as other operations that change
-the state of the filesystem, will be denied.
-.It Fl u Ar umask
-Sets an explicit
-.Xr umask 2
-to be applied to newly-created files and directories, instead of the
-user's default mask.
-.El
-.Pp
-On some systems,
-.Nm
-must be able to access
-.Pa /dev/log
-for logging to work, and use of
-.Nm
-in a chroot configuration therefore requires that
-.Xr syslogd 8
-establish a logging socket inside the chroot directory.

+.Sh NAME
+.Nm ssh_config
+.Nd OpenSSH SSH client configuration files
+.Sh SYNOPSIS
+.Nm ~/.ssh/config
+.Nm /etc/ssh/ssh_config
+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+.Xr ssh 1
+obtains configuration data from the following sources in
+the following order:
+.Pp
+.Bl -enum -offset indent -compact
+.It
+command-line options
+.It
+user's configuration file
+.Pq Pa ~/.ssh/config
+.It
+system-wide configuration file
+.Pq Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_config
+.El
+.Pp
+For each parameter, the first obtained value
+will be used.
+The configuration files contain sections separated by
+.Cm Host
+specifications, and that section is only applied for hosts that
+match one of the patterns given in the specification.
+The matched host name is usually the one given on the command line
+(see the
+.Cm CanonicalizeHostname
+option for exceptions).
+.Pp
+Since the first obtained value for each parameter is used, more
+host-specific declarations should be given near the beginning of the
+file, and general defaults at the end.
+.Pp
+The file contains keyword-argument pairs, one per line.
+Lines starting with
+.Ql #
+and empty lines are interpreted as comments.
+Arguments may optionally be enclosed in double quotes
+.Pq \&"
+in order to represent arguments containing spaces.
+Configuration options may be separated by whitespace or
+optional whitespace and exactly one
+.Ql = ;
+the latter format is useful to avoid the need to quote whitespace
+when specifying configuration options using the
+.Nm ssh ,
+.Nm scp ,
+and
+.Nm sftp
+.Fl o
+option.
+.Pp
+The possible
+keywords and their meanings are as follows (note that
+keywords are case-insensitive and arguments are case-sensitive):
+.Bl -tag -width Ds
+.It Cm Host
+Restricts the following declarations (up to the next
+.Cm Host
+or
+.Cm Match
+keyword) to be only for those hosts that match one of the patterns
+given after the keyword.
+If more than one pattern is provided, they should be separated by whitespace.
+A single
+.Ql *
+as a pattern can be used to provide global
+defaults for all hosts.
+The host is usually the
+.Ar hostname
+argument given on the command line
+(see the
+.Cm CanonicalizeHostname
+keyword for exceptions).
+.Pp
+A pattern entry may be negated by prefixing it with an exclamation mark
+.Pq Sq !\& .
+If a negated entry is matched, then the
+.Cm Host
+entry is ignored, regardless of whether any other patterns on the line
+match.
+Negated matches are therefore useful to provide exceptions for wildcard
+matches.
+.Pp
+See
+.Sx PATTERNS
+for more information on patterns.
+.It Cm Match
+Restricts the following declarations (up to the next
+.Cm Host
+or
+.Cm Match
+keyword) to be used only when the conditions following the
+.Cm Match
+keyword are satisfied.
+Match conditions are specified using one or more criteria
+or the single token
+.Cm all
+which always matches.
+The available criteria keywords are:
+.Cm canonical ,
+.Cm exec ,
+.Cm host ,
+.Cm originalhost ,
+.Cm user ,
+and
+.Cm localuser .
+The
+.Cm all
+criteria must appear alone or immediately after
+.Cm canonical .
+Other criteria may be combined arbitrarily.
+All criteria but
+.Cm all
+and
+.Cm canonical
+require an argument.
+Criteria may be negated by prepending an exclamation mark
+.Pq Sq !\& .
+.Pp
+The
+.Cm canonical
+keyword matches only when the configuration file is being re-parsed
+after hostname canonicalization (see the
+.Cm CanonicalizeHostname
+option.)
+This may be useful to specify conditions that work with canonical host
+names only.
+The
+.Cm exec
+keyword executes the specified command under the user's shell.
+If the command returns a zero exit status then the condition is considered true.
+Commands containing whitespace characters must be quoted.
+Arguments to
+.Cm exec
+accept the tokens described in the
+.Sx TOKENS
+section.
+.Pp
+The other keywords' criteria must be single entries or comma-separated
+lists and may use the wildcard and negation operators described in the
+.Sx PATTERNS
+section.
+The criteria for the
+.Cm host
+keyword are matched against the target hostname, after any substitution
+by the
+.Cm Hostname
+or
+.Cm CanonicalizeHostname
+options.
+The
+.Cm originalhost
+keyword matches against the hostname as it was specified on the command-line.
+The
+.Cm user
+keyword matches against the target username on the remote host.
+The
+.Cm localuser
+keyword matches against the name of the local user running
+.Xr ssh 1
+(this keyword may be useful in system-wide
+.Nm
+files).
+.It Cm AddKeysToAgent
+Specifies whether keys should be automatically added to a running
+.Xr ssh-agent 1 .
+If this option is set to
+.Cm yes
+and a key is loaded from a file, the key and its passphrase are added to
+the agent with the default lifetime, as if by
+.Xr ssh-add 1 .
+If this option is set to
+.Cm ask ,
+.Xr ssh 1
+will require confirmation using the
+.Ev SSH_ASKPASS
+program before adding a key (see
+.Xr ssh-add 1
+for details).
+If this option is set to
+.Cm confirm ,
+each use of the key must be confirmed, as if the
+.Fl c
+option was specified to
+.Xr ssh-add 1 .
+If this option is set to
+.Cm no ,
+no keys are added to the agent.
+The argument must be
+.Cm yes ,
+.Cm confirm ,
+.Cm ask ,
+or
+.Cm no
+(the default).
+.It Cm AddressFamily
+Specifies which address family to use when connecting.
+Valid arguments are
+.Cm any
+(the default),
+.Cm inet
+(use IPv4 only), or
+.Cm inet6
+(use IPv6 only).
+.It Cm BatchMode
+If set to
+.Cm yes ,
+passphrase/password querying will be disabled.
+This option is useful in scripts and other batch jobs where no user
+is present to supply the password.
+The argument must be
+.Cm yes
+or
+.Cm no
+(the default).
+.It Cm BindAddress
+Use the specified address on the local machine as the source address of
+the connection.
+Only useful on systems with more than one address.
+Note that this option does not work if
+.Cm UsePrivilegedPort
+is set to
+.Cm yes .
+.It Cm CanonicalDomains
+When
+.Cm CanonicalizeHostname
+is enabled, this option specifies the list of domain suffixes in which to
+search for the specified destination host.
+.It Cm CanonicalizeFallbackLocal
+Specifies whether to fail with an error when hostname canonicalization fails.
+The default,
+.Cm yes ,
+will attempt to look up the unqualified hostname using the system resolver's
+search rules.
+A value of
+.Cm no
+will cause
+.Xr ssh 1
+to fail instantly if
+.Cm CanonicalizeHostname
+is enabled and the target hostname cannot be found in any of the domains
+specified by
+.Cm CanonicalDomains .
+.It Cm CanonicalizeHostname
+Controls whether explicit hostname canonicalization is performed.
+The default,
+.Cm no ,
+is not to perform any name rewriting and let the system resolver handle all
+hostname lookups.
+If set to
+.Cm yes
+then, for connections that do not use a
+.Cm ProxyCommand ,
+.Xr ssh 1
+will attempt to canonicalize the hostname specified on the command line
+using the
+.Cm CanonicalDomains
+suffixes and
+.Cm CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs
+rules.
+If
+.Cm CanonicalizeHostname
+is set to
+.Cm always ,
+then canonicalization is applied to proxied connections too.
+.Pp
+If this option is enabled, then the configuration files are processed
+again using the new target name to pick up any new configuration in matching
+.Cm Host
+and
+.Cm Match
+stanzas.
+.It Cm CanonicalizeMaxDots
+Specifies the maximum number of dot characters in a hostname before
+canonicalization is disabled.
+The default, 1,
+allows a single dot (i.e. hostname.subdomain).
+.It Cm CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs
+Specifies rules to determine whether CNAMEs should be followed when
+canonicalizing hostnames.
+The rules consist of one or more arguments of
+.Ar source_domain_list : Ns Ar target_domain_list ,
+where
+.Ar source_domain_list
+is a pattern-list of domains that may follow CNAMEs in canonicalization,
+and
+.Ar target_domain_list
+is a pattern-list of domains that they may resolve to.
+.Pp
+For example,
+.Qq *.a.example.com:*.b.example.com,*.c.example.com
+will allow hostnames matching
+.Qq *.a.example.com
+to be canonicalized to names in the
+.Qq *.b.example.com
+or
+.Qq *.c.example.com
+domains.
+.It Cm CertificateFile
+Specifies a file from which the user's certificate is read.
+A corresponding private key must be provided separately in order
+to use this certificate either
+from an
+.Cm IdentityFile
+directive or
+.Fl i
+flag to
+.Xr ssh 1 ,
+via
+.Xr ssh-agent 1 ,
+or via a
+.Cm PKCS11Provider .
+.Pp
+Arguments to
+.Cm CertificateFile
+may use the tilde syntax to refer to a user's home directory
+or the tokens described in the
+.Sx TOKENS
+section.
+.Pp
+It is possible to have multiple certificate files specified in
+configuration files; these certificates will be tried in sequence.
+Multiple
+.Cm CertificateFile
+directives will add to the list of certificates used for
+authentication.
+.It Cm ChallengeResponseAuthentication
+Specifies whether to use challenge-response authentication.
+The argument to this keyword must be
+.Cm yes
+(the default)
+or
+.Cm no .
+.It Cm CheckHostIP
+If set to
+.Cm yes
+(the default),
+.Xr ssh 1
+will additionally check the host IP address in the
+.Pa known_hosts
+file.
+This allows it to detect if a host key changed due to DNS spoofing
+and will add addresses of destination hosts to
+.Pa ~/.ssh/known_hosts
+in the process, regardless of the setting of
+.Cm StrictHostKeyChecking .
+If the option is set to
+.Cm no ,
+the check will not be executed.
+.It Cm Cipher
+Specifies the cipher to use for encrypting the session
+in protocol version 1.
+Currently,
+.Cm blowfish ,
+.Cm 3des
+(the default),
+and
+.Cm des
+are supported,
+though
+.Cm des
+is only supported in the
+.Xr ssh 1
+client for interoperability with legacy protocol 1 implementations;
+its use is strongly discouraged due to cryptographic weaknesses.
+.It Cm Ciphers
+Specifies the ciphers allowed for protocol version 2
+in order of preference.
+Multiple ciphers must be comma-separated.
+If the specified value begins with a
+.Sq +
+character, then the specified ciphers will be appended to the default set
+instead of replacing them.
+.Pp
+The supported ciphers are:
+.Bd -literal -offset indent
+3des-cbc
+aes128-cbc
+aes192-cbc
+aes256-cbc
+aes128-ctr
+aes192-ctr
+aes256-ctr
+aes128-gcm@openssh.com
+aes256-gcm@openssh.com
+arcfour
+arcfour128
+arcfour256
+blowfish-cbc
+cast128-cbc
+chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com
+.Ed
+.Pp
+The default is:
+.Bd -literal -offset indent
+chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,
+aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,
+aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com,
+aes128-cbc,aes192-cbc,aes256-cbc
+.Ed
+.Pp
+The list of available ciphers may also be obtained using
+.Qq ssh -Q cipher .
+.It Cm ClearAllForwardings
+Specifies that all local, remote, and dynamic port forwardings
+specified in the configuration files or on the command line be
+cleared.
+This option is primarily useful when used from the
+.Xr ssh 1
+command line to clear port forwardings set in
+configuration files, and is automatically set by
+.Xr scp 1
+and
+.Xr sftp 1 .
+The argument must be
+.Cm yes
+or
+.Cm no
+(the default).
+.It Cm Compression
+Specifies whether to use compression.
+The argument must be
+.Cm yes
+or
+.Cm no
+(the default).
+.It Cm CompressionLevel
+Specifies the compression level to use if compression is enabled.
+The argument must be an integer from 1 (fast) to 9 (slow, best).
+The default level is 6, which is good for most applications.
+The meaning of the values is the same as in
+.Xr gzip 1 .
+Note that this option applies to protocol version 1 only.
+.It Cm ConnectionAttempts
+Specifies the number of tries (one per second) to make before exiting.
+The argument must be an integer.
+This may be useful in scripts if the connection sometimes fails.
+The default is 1.
+.It Cm ConnectTimeout
+Specifies the timeout (in seconds) used when connecting to the
+SSH server, instead of using the default system TCP timeout.
+This value is used only when the target is down or really unreachable,
+not when it refuses the connection.
+.It Cm ControlMaster
+Enables the sharing of multiple sessions over a single network connection.
+When set to
+.Cm yes ,
+.Xr ssh 1
+will listen for connections on a control socket specified using the
+.Cm ControlPath
+argument.
+Additional sessions can connect to this socket using the same
+.Cm ControlPath
+with
+.Cm ControlMaster
+set to
+.Cm no
+(the default).
+These sessions will try to reuse the master instance's network connection
+rather than initiating new ones, but will fall back to connecting normally
+if the control socket does not exist, or is not listening.
+.Pp
+Setting this to
+.Cm ask
+will cause
+.Xr ssh 1
+to listen for control connections, but require confirmation using
+.Xr ssh-askpass 1 .
+If the
+.Cm ControlPath
+cannot be opened,
+.Xr ssh 1
+will continue without connecting to a master instance.
+.Pp
+X11 and
+.Xr ssh-agent 1
+forwarding is supported over these multiplexed connections, however the
+display and agent forwarded will be the one belonging to the master
+connection i.e. it is not possible to forward multiple displays or agents.
+.Pp
+Two additional options allow for opportunistic multiplexing: try to use a
+master connection but fall back to creating a new one if one does not already
+exist.
+These options are:
+.Cm auto
+and
+.Cm autoask .
+The latter requires confirmation like the
+.Cm ask
+option.
+.It Cm ControlPath
+Specify the path to the control socket used for connection sharing as described
+in the
+.Cm ControlMaster
+section above or the string
+.Cm none
+to disable connection sharing.
+Arguments to
+.Cm ControlPath
+may use the tilde syntax to refer to a user's home directory
+or the tokens described in the
+.Sx TOKENS
+section.
+It is recommended that any
+.Cm ControlPath
+used for opportunistic connection sharing include
+at least %h, %p, and %r (or alternatively %C) and be placed in a directory
+that is not writable by other users.
+This ensures that shared connections are uniquely identified.
+.It Cm ControlPersist
+When used in conjunction with
+.Cm ControlMaster ,
+specifies that the master connection should remain open
+in the background (waiting for future client connections)
+after the initial client connection has been closed.
+If set to
+.Cm no ,
+then the master connection will not be placed into the background,
+and will close as soon as the initial client connection is closed.
+If set to
+.Cm yes
+or 0,
+then the master connection will remain in the background indefinitely
+(until killed or closed via a mechanism such as the
+.Qq ssh -O exit ) .
+If set to a time in seconds, or a time in any of the formats documented in
+.Xr sshd_config 4 ,
+then the backgrounded master connection will automatically terminate
+after it has remained idle (with no client connections) for the
+specified time.
+.It Cm DynamicForward
+Specifies that a TCP port on the local machine be forwarded
+over the secure channel, and the application
+protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the
+remote machine.
+.Pp
+The argument must be
+.Sm off
+.Oo Ar bind_address : Oc Ar port .
+.Sm on
+IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing addresses in square brackets.
+By default, the local port is bound in accordance with the
+.Cm GatewayPorts
+setting.
+However, an explicit
+.Ar bind_address
+may be used to bind the connection to a specific address.
+The
+.Ar bind_address
+of
+.Cm localhost
+indicates that the listening port be bound for local use only, while an
+empty address or
+.Sq *
+indicates that the port should be available from all interfaces.
+.Pp
+Currently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and
+.Xr ssh 1
+will act as a SOCKS server.
+Multiple forwardings may be specified, and
+additional forwardings can be given on the command line.
+Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.
+.It Cm EnableSSHKeysign
+Setting this option to
+.Cm yes
+in the global client configuration file
+.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_config
+enables the use of the helper program
+.Xr ssh-keysign 1M
+during
+.Cm HostbasedAuthentication .
+The argument must be
+.Cm yes
+or
+.Cm no
+(the default).
+This option should be placed in the non-hostspecific section.
+See
+.Xr ssh-keysign 1M
+for more information.
+.It Cm EscapeChar
+Sets the escape character (default:
+.Ql ~ ) .
+The escape character can also
+be set on the command line.
+The argument should be a single character,
+.Ql ^
+followed by a letter, or
+.Cm none
+to disable the escape
+character entirely (making the connection transparent for binary
+data).
+.It Cm ExitOnForwardFailure
+Specifies whether
+.Xr ssh 1
+should terminate the connection if it cannot set up all requested
+dynamic, tunnel, local, and remote port forwardings, (e.g.\&
+if either end is unable to bind and listen on a specified port).
+Note that
+.Cm ExitOnForwardFailure
+does not apply to connections made over port forwardings and will not,
+for example, cause
+.Xr ssh 1
+to exit if TCP connections to the ultimate forwarding destination fail.
+The argument must be
+.Cm yes
+or
+.Cm no
+(the default).
+.It Cm FingerprintHash
+Specifies the hash algorithm used when displaying key fingerprints.
+Valid options are:
+.Cm md5
+and
+.Cm sha256
+(the default).
+.It Cm ForwardAgent
+Specifies whether the connection to the authentication agent (if any)
+will be forwarded to the remote machine.
+The argument must be
+.Cm yes
+or
+.Cm no
+(the default).
+.Pp
+Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution.
+Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host
+(for the agent's Unix-domain socket)
+can access the local agent through the forwarded connection.
+An attacker cannot obtain key material from the agent,
+however they can perform operations on the keys that enable them to
+authenticate using the identities loaded into the agent.
+.It Cm ForwardX11
+Specifies whether X11 connections will be automatically redirected
+over the secure channel and
+.Ev DISPLAY
+set.
+The argument must be
+.Cm yes
+or
+.Cm no
+(the default).
+.Pp
+X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution.
+Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host
+(for the user's X11 authorization database)
+can access the local X11 display through the forwarded connection.
+An attacker may then be able to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring
+if the
+.Cm ForwardX11Trusted
+option is also enabled.
+.It Cm ForwardX11Timeout
+Specify a timeout for untrusted X11 forwarding
+using the format described in the
+.Sx TIME FORMATS
+section of
+.Xr sshd_config 4 .
+X11 connections received by
+.Xr ssh 1
+after this time will be refused.
+The default is to disable untrusted X11 forwarding after twenty minutes has
+elapsed.
+.It Cm ForwardX11Trusted
+If this option is set to
+.Cm yes ,
+remote X11 clients will have full access to the original X11 display.
+.Pp
+If this option is set to
+.Cm no
+(the default),
+remote X11 clients will be considered untrusted and prevented
+from stealing or tampering with data belonging to trusted X11
+clients.
+Furthermore, the
+.Xr xauth 1
+token used for the session will be set to expire after 20 minutes.
+Remote clients will be refused access after this time.
+.Pp
+See the X11 SECURITY extension specification for full details on
+the restrictions imposed on untrusted clients.
+.It Cm GatewayPorts
+Specifies whether remote hosts are allowed to connect to local
+forwarded ports.
+By default,
+.Xr ssh 1
+binds local port forwardings to the loopback address.
+This prevents other remote hosts from connecting to forwarded ports.
+.Cm GatewayPorts
+can be used to specify that ssh
+should bind local port forwardings to the wildcard address,
+thus allowing remote hosts to connect to forwarded ports.
+The argument must be
+.Cm yes
+or
+.Cm no
+(the default).
+.It Cm GlobalKnownHostsFile
+Specifies one or more files to use for the global

+.It Cm HashKnownHosts
+Indicates that
+.Xr ssh 1
+should hash host names and addresses when they are added to
+.Pa ~/.ssh/known_hosts .
+These hashed names may be used normally by
+.Xr ssh 1
+and
+.Xr sshd 1M ,
+but they do not reveal identifying information should the file's contents
+be disclosed.
+The default is
+.Cm no .
+Note that existing names and addresses in known hosts files
+will not be converted automatically,
+but may be manually hashed using
+.Xr ssh-keygen 1 .
+.It Cm HostbasedAuthentication
+Specifies whether to try rhosts based authentication with public key
+authentication.
+The argument must be

+or passed on the
+.Xr ssh 1
+command-line,
+even if
+.Xr ssh-agent 1
+or a
+.Cm PKCS11Provider
+offers more identities.
+The argument to this keyword must be
+.Cm yes
+or
+.Cm no
+(the default).
+This option is intended for situations where ssh-agent
+offers many different identities.
+.It Cm IdentityAgent
+Specifies the
+.Ux Ns -domain
+socket used to communicate with the authentication agent.
+.Pp
+This option overrides the
+.Ev SSH_AUTH_SOCK
+environment variable and can be used to select a specific agent.
+Setting the socket name to
+.Cm none
+disables the use of an authentication agent.
+If the string
+.Qq SSH_AUTH_SOCK
+is specified, the location of the socket will be read from the
+.Ev SSH_AUTH_SOCK
+environment variable.
+.Pp
+Arguments to
+.Cm IdentityAgent
+may use the tilde syntax to refer to a user's home directory
+or the tokens described in the

+.Pa ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa ,
+.Pa ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
+and
+.Pa ~/.ssh/id_rsa
+for protocol version 2.
+Additionally, any identities represented by the authentication agent
+will be used for authentication unless
+.Cm IdentitiesOnly
+is set.
+If no certificates have been explicitly specified by
+.Cm CertificateFile ,
+.Xr ssh 1
+will try to load certificate information from the filename obtained by
+appending
+.Pa -cert.pub
+to the path of a specified
+.Cm IdentityFile .
+.Pp
+Arguments to
+.Cm IdentityFile
+may use the tilde syntax to refer to a user's home directory
+or the tokens described in the
+.Sx TOKENS
+section.
+.Pp
+It is possible to have
+multiple identity files specified in configuration files; all these
+identities will be tried in sequence.
+Multiple
+.Cm IdentityFile
+directives will add to the list of identities tried (this behaviour
+differs from that of other configuration directives).
+.Pp
+.Cm IdentityFile
+may be used in conjunction with
+.Cm IdentitiesOnly
+to select which identities in an agent are offered during authentication.
+.Cm IdentityFile
+may also be used in conjunction with
+.Cm CertificateFile
+in order to provide any certificate also needed for authentication with
+the identity.
+.It Cm IgnoreUnknown
+Specifies a pattern-list of unknown options to be ignored if they are
+encountered in configuration parsing.
+This may be used to suppress errors if
+.Nm
+contains options that are unrecognised by

+.It Cm LocalCommand
+Specifies a command to execute on the local machine after successfully
+connecting to the server.
+The command string extends to the end of the line, and is executed with
+the user's shell.
+Arguments to
+.Cm LocalCommand
+accept the tokens described in the
+.Sx TOKENS
+section.
+.Pp
+The command is run synchronously and does not have access to the
+session of the
+.Xr ssh 1
+that spawned it.
+It should not be used for interactive commands.
+.Pp
+This directive is ignored unless
+.Cm PermitLocalCommand
+has been enabled.
+.It Cm LocalForward
+Specifies that a TCP port on the local machine be forwarded over
+the secure channel to the specified host and port from the remote machine.
+The first argument must be
+.Sm off
+.Oo Ar bind_address : Oc Ar port
+.Sm on
+and the second argument must be
+.Ar host : Ns Ar hostport .
+IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing addresses in square brackets.
+Multiple forwardings may be specified, and additional forwardings can be
+given on the command line.
+Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.
+By default, the local port is bound in accordance with the
+.Cm GatewayPorts
+setting.
+However, an explicit
+.Ar bind_address
+may be used to bind the connection to a specific address.
+The
+.Ar bind_address
+of
+.Cm localhost
+indicates that the listening port be bound for local use only, while an
+empty address or
+.Sq *
+indicates that the port should be available from all interfaces.
+.It Cm LogLevel
+Gives the verbosity level that is used when logging messages from
+.Xr ssh 1 .
+The possible values are:
+QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3.
+The default is INFO.
+DEBUG and DEBUG1 are equivalent.
+DEBUG2 and DEBUG3 each specify higher levels of verbose output.
+.It Cm MACs
+Specifies the MAC (message authentication code) algorithms
+in order of preference.
+The MAC algorithm is used for data integrity protection.
+Multiple algorithms must be comma-separated.
+If the specified value begins with a
+.Sq +
+character, then the specified algorithms will be appended to the default set
+instead of replacing them.
+.Pp
+The algorithms that contain
+.Qq -etm
+calculate the MAC after encryption (encrypt-then-mac).
+These are considered safer and their use recommended.
+.Pp
+The default is:
+.Bd -literal -offset indent
+umac-64-etm@openssh.com,umac-128-etm@openssh.com,
+hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,

+hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha1
+.Ed
+.Pp
+The list of available MAC algorithms may also be obtained using
+.Qq ssh -Q mac .
+.It Cm NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost
+This option can be used if the home directory is shared across machines.
+In this case localhost will refer to a different machine on each of
+the machines and the user will get many warnings about changed host keys.
+However, this option disables host authentication for localhost.
+The argument to this keyword must be
+.Cm yes
+or
+.Cm no .
+(the default).
+.It Cm NumberOfPasswordPrompts
+Specifies the number of password prompts before giving up.
+The argument to this keyword must be an integer.
+The default is 3.
+.It Cm PasswordAuthentication
+Specifies whether to use password authentication.
+The argument to this keyword must be
+.Cm yes
+(the default)
+or
+.Cm no .
+.It Cm PermitLocalCommand
+Allow local command execution via the
+.Ic LocalCommand
+option or using the
+.Ic !\& Ns Ar command
+escape sequence in
+.Xr ssh 1 .
+The argument must be
+.Cm yes
+or
+.Cm no
+(the default).
+.It Cm PKCS11Provider
+Specifies which PKCS#11 provider to use.
+The argument to this keyword is the PKCS#11 shared library
+.Xr ssh 1
+should use to communicate with a PKCS#11 token providing the user's
+private RSA key.
+.It Cm Port
+Specifies the port number to connect on the remote host.
+The default is 22.
+.It Cm PreferredAuthentications
+Specifies the order in which the client should try authentication methods.
+This allows a client to prefer one method (e.g.\&
+.Cm keyboard-interactive )
+over another method (e.g.\&
+.Cm password ) .
+The default is:
+.Bd -literal -offset indent
+gssapi-with-mic,hostbased,publickey,
+keyboard-interactive,password
+.Ed
+.It Cm Protocol
+Specifies the protocol versions
+.Xr ssh 1
+should support in order of preference.
+The possible values are 1 and 2.
+Multiple versions must be comma-separated.
+When this option is set to
+.Cm 2,1
+.Nm ssh
+will try version 2 and fall back to version 1
+if version 2 is not available.
+The default is version 2.
+Protocol 1 suffers from a number of cryptographic weaknesses and should
+not be used.
+It is only offered to support legacy devices.
+.It Cm ProxyCommand
+Specifies the command to use to connect to the server.
+The command
+string extends to the end of the line, and is executed
+using the user's shell
+.Ql exec
+directive to avoid a lingering shell process.
+.Pp
+Arguments to
+.Cm ProxyCommand
+accept the tokens described in the
+.Sx TOKENS
+section.
+The command can be basically anything,
+and should read from its standard input and write to its standard output.
+It should eventually connect an
+.Xr sshd 1M
+server running on some machine, or execute
+.Ic sshd -i
+somewhere.
+Host key management will be done using the
+HostName of the host being connected (defaulting to the name typed by
+the user).
+Setting the command to
+.Cm none
+disables this option entirely.
+Note that
+.Cm CheckHostIP
+is not available for connects with a proxy command.
+.Pp
+This directive is useful in conjunction with
+.Xr nc 1
+and its proxy support.
+For example, the following directive would connect via an HTTP proxy at
+192.0.2.0:
+.Bd -literal -offset 3n
+ProxyCommand /usr/bin/nc -X connect -x 192.0.2.0:8080 %h %p
+.Ed
+.It Cm ProxyJump
+Specifies one or more jump proxies as
+.Xo
+.Sm off
+.Op Ar user No @
+.Ar host
+.Op : Ns Ar port
+.Sm on
+.Xc .
+Multiple proxies may be separated by comma characters and will be visited
+sequentially.
+Setting this option will cause
+.Xr ssh 1
+to connect to the target host by first making a
+.Xr ssh 1
+connection to the specified
+.Cm ProxyJump
+host and then establishing a
+TCP forwarding to the ultimate target from there.
+.Pp
+Note that this option will compete with the
+.Cm ProxyCommand
+option - whichever is specified first will prevent later instances of the
+other from taking effect.
+.It Cm ProxyUseFdpass
+Specifies that
+.Cm ProxyCommand
+will pass a connected file descriptor back to
+.Xr ssh 1
+instead of continuing to execute and pass data.
+The default is
+.Cm no .
+.It Cm PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes
+Specifies the key types that will be used for public key authentication
+as a comma-separated pattern list.
+Alternately if the specified value begins with a
+.Sq +
+character, then the key types after it will be appended to the default
+instead of replacing it.
+The default for this option is:
+.Bd -literal -offset 3n
+ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,

+ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,
+ssh-ed25519,ssh-rsa
+.Ed
+.Pp
+The list of available key types may also be obtained using
+.Qq ssh -Q key .
+.It Cm PubkeyAuthentication
+Specifies whether to try public key authentication.
+The argument to this keyword must be
+.Cm yes
+(the default)
+or
+.Cm no .
+.It Cm RekeyLimit
+Specifies the maximum amount of data that may be transmitted before the
+session key is renegotiated, optionally followed a maximum amount of
+time that may pass before the session key is renegotiated.
+The first argument is specified in bytes and may have a suffix of
+.Sq K ,
+.Sq M ,
+or
+.Sq G
+to indicate Kilobytes, Megabytes, or Gigabytes, respectively.
+The default is between
+.Sq 1G
+and
+.Sq 4G ,
+depending on the cipher.
+The optional second value is specified in seconds and may use any of the
+units documented in the
+.Sx TIME FORMATS
+section of
+.Xr sshd_config 4 .
+The default value for
+.Cm RekeyLimit
+is
+.Cm default none ,
+which means that rekeying is performed after the cipher's default amount
+of data has been sent or received and no time based rekeying is done.
+.It Cm RemoteForward
+Specifies that a TCP port on the remote machine be forwarded over
+the secure channel to the specified host and port from the local machine.
+The first argument must be
+.Sm off
+.Oo Ar bind_address : Oc Ar port
+.Sm on
+and the second argument must be
+.Ar host : Ns Ar hostport .
+IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing addresses in square brackets.
+Multiple forwardings may be specified, and additional
+forwardings can be given on the command line.
+Privileged ports can be forwarded only when
+logging in as root on the remote machine.
+.Pp
+If the
+.Ar port
+argument is 0,
+the listen port will be dynamically allocated on the server and reported
+to the client at run time.
+.Pp
+If the
+.Ar bind_address
+is not specified, the default is to only bind to loopback addresses.
+If the
+.Ar bind_address
+is
+.Ql *
+or an empty string, then the forwarding is requested to listen on all
+interfaces.
+Specifying a remote
+.Ar bind_address
+will only succeed if the server's
+.Cm GatewayPorts
+option is enabled (see
+.Xr sshd_config 4 ) .
+.It Cm RequestTTY
+Specifies whether to request a pseudo-tty for the session.
+The argument may be one of:
+.Cm no
+(never request a TTY),
+.Cm yes
+(always request a TTY when standard input is a TTY),
+.Cm force
+(always request a TTY) or
+.Cm auto
+(request a TTY when opening a login session).
+This option mirrors the
+.Fl t
+and
+.Fl T
+flags for
+.Xr ssh 1 .
+.It Cm RevokedHostKeys
+Specifies revoked host public keys.
+Keys listed in this file will be refused for host authentication.
+Note that if this file does not exist or is not readable,
+then host authentication will be refused for all hosts.
+Keys may be specified as a text file, listing one public key per line, or as
+an OpenSSH Key Revocation List (KRL) as generated by
+.Xr ssh-keygen 1 .
+For more information on KRLs, see the KEY REVOCATION LISTS section in
+.Xr ssh-keygen 1 .
+.It Cm RhostsRSAAuthentication
+Specifies whether to try rhosts based authentication with RSA host
+authentication.
+The argument must be
+.Cm yes
+or
+.Cm no
+(the default).
+This option applies to protocol version 1 only and requires
+.Xr ssh 1
+to be setuid root.
+.It Cm RSAAuthentication
+Specifies whether to try RSA authentication.
+The argument to this keyword must be
+.Cm yes
+(the default)
+or
+.Cm no .
+RSA authentication will only be
+attempted if the identity file exists, or an authentication agent is
+running.
+Note that this option applies to protocol version 1 only.
+.It Cm SendEnv
+Specifies what variables from the local
+.Xr environ 7
+should be sent to the server.
+The server must also support it, and the server must be configured to
+accept these environment variables.
+Note that the
+.Ev TERM
+environment variable is always sent whenever a
+pseudo-terminal is requested as it is required by the protocol.
+Refer to
+.Cm AcceptEnv
+in
+.Xr sshd_config 4
+for how to configure the server.
+Variables are specified by name, which may contain wildcard characters.
+Multiple environment variables may be separated by whitespace or spread
+across multiple
+.Cm SendEnv
+directives.
+The default is not to send any environment variables.
+.Pp
+See
+.Sx PATTERNS
+for more information on patterns.
+.It Cm ServerAliveCountMax
+Sets the number of server alive messages (see below) which may be
+sent without
+.Xr ssh 1
+receiving any messages back from the server.
+If this threshold is reached while server alive messages are being sent,
+ssh will disconnect from the server, terminating the session.
+It is important to note that the use of server alive messages is very
+different from
+.Cm TCPKeepAlive
+(below).
+The server alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel
+and therefore will not be spoofable.
+The TCP keepalive option enabled by
+.Cm TCPKeepAlive
+is spoofable.
+The server alive mechanism is valuable when the client or
+server depend on knowing when a connection has become inactive.
+.Pp
+The default value is 3.
+If, for example,
+.Cm ServerAliveInterval
+(see below) is set to 15 and
+.Cm ServerAliveCountMax
+is left at the default, if the server becomes unresponsive,
+ssh will disconnect after approximately 45 seconds.
+.It Cm ServerAliveInterval
+Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received
+from the server,
+.Xr ssh 1
+will send a message through the encrypted
+channel to request a response from the server.
+The default
+is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the server.
+.It Cm StreamLocalBindMask
+Sets the octal file creation mode mask
+.Pq umask
+used when creating a Unix-domain socket file for local or remote
+port forwarding.
+This option is only used for port forwarding to a Unix-domain socket file.
+.Pp
+The default value is 0177, which creates a Unix-domain socket file that is
+readable and writable only by the owner.
+Note that not all operating systems honor the file mode on Unix-domain
+socket files.
+.It Cm StreamLocalBindUnlink
+Specifies whether to remove an existing Unix-domain socket file for local
+or remote port forwarding before creating a new one.
+If the socket file already exists and
+.Cm StreamLocalBindUnlink
+is not enabled,
+.Nm ssh
+will be unable to forward the port to the Unix-domain socket file.
+This option is only used for port forwarding to a Unix-domain socket file.
+.Pp
+The argument must be
+.Cm yes
+or
+.Cm no
+(the default).
+.It Cm StrictHostKeyChecking
+If this flag is set to
+.Cm yes ,
+.Xr ssh 1
+will never automatically add host keys to the
+.Pa ~/.ssh/known_hosts
+file, and refuses to connect to hosts whose host key has changed.
+This provides maximum protection against trojan horse attacks,
+though it can be annoying when the
+.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts
+file is poorly maintained or when connections to new hosts are
+frequently made.
+This option forces the user to manually
+add all new hosts.
+If this flag is set to
+.Cm no ,
+ssh will automatically add new host keys to the
+user known hosts files.
+If this flag is set to
+.Cm ask
+(the default),
+new host keys
+will be added to the user known host files only after the user
+has confirmed that is what they really want to do, and
+ssh will refuse to connect to hosts whose host key has changed.
+The host keys of
+known hosts will be verified automatically in all cases.
+.It Cm TCPKeepAlive
+Specifies whether the system should send TCP keepalive messages to the
+other side.
+If they are sent, death of the connection or crash of one
+of the machines will be properly noticed.
+However, this means that
+connections will die if the route is down temporarily, and some people
+find it annoying.
+.Pp
+The default is
+.Cm yes
+(to send TCP keepalive messages), and the client will notice
+if the network goes down or the remote host dies.
+This is important in scripts, and many users want it too.
+.Pp
+To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should be set to
+.Cm no .
+.It Cm Tunnel
+Request
+.Xr tun 4
+device forwarding between the client and the server.
+The argument must be
+.Cm yes ,
+.Cm point-to-point
+(layer 3),
+.Cm ethernet
+(layer 2),
+or
+.Cm no
+(the default).
+Specifying
+.Cm yes
+requests the default tunnel mode, which is
+.Cm point-to-point .
+.It Cm TunnelDevice
+Specifies the
+.Xr tun 4
+devices to open on the client
+.Pq Ar local_tun
+and the server
+.Pq Ar remote_tun .
+.Pp
+The argument must be
+.Sm off
+.Ar local_tun Op : Ar remote_tun .
+.Sm on
+The devices may be specified by numerical ID or the keyword
+.Cm any ,
+which uses the next available tunnel device.
+If
+.Ar remote_tun
+is not specified, it defaults to
+.Cm any .
+The default is
+.Cm any:any .
+.It Cm UpdateHostKeys
+Specifies whether
+.Xr ssh 1
+should accept notifications of additional hostkeys from the server sent
+after authentication has completed and add them to
+.Cm UserKnownHostsFile .
+The argument must be
+.Cm yes ,
+.Cm no
+(the default) or
+.Cm ask .
+Enabling this option allows learning alternate hostkeys for a server
+and supports graceful key rotation by allowing a server to send replacement
+public keys before old ones are removed.
+Additional hostkeys are only accepted if the key used to authenticate the
+host was already trusted or explicitly accepted by the user.
+If
+.Cm UpdateHostKeys
+is set to
+.Cm ask ,
+then the user is asked to confirm the modifications to the known_hosts file.
+Confirmation is currently incompatible with
+.Cm ControlPersist ,
+and will be disabled if it is enabled.
+.Pp
+Presently, only

+Specifies whether to verify the remote key using DNS and SSHFP resource
+records.
+If this option is set to
+.Cm yes ,
+the client will implicitly trust keys that match a secure fingerprint
+from DNS.
+Insecure fingerprints will be handled as if this option was set to
+.Cm ask .
+If this option is set to
+.Cm ask ,
+information on fingerprint match will be displayed, but the user will still

-.Os
-.Sh NAME
-.Nm ssh_config
-.Nd OpenSSH SSH client configuration files
-.Sh SYNOPSIS
-.Nm ~/.ssh/config
-.Nm /etc/ssh/ssh_config
-.Sh DESCRIPTION
-.Xr ssh 1
-obtains configuration data from the following sources in
-the following order:
-.Pp
-.Bl -enum -offset indent -compact
-.It
-command-line options
-.It
-user's configuration file
-.Pq Pa ~/.ssh/config
-.It
-system-wide configuration file
-.Pq Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_config
-.El
-.Pp
-For each parameter, the first obtained value
-will be used.
-The configuration files contain sections separated by
-.Cm Host
-specifications, and that section is only applied for hosts that
-match one of the patterns given in the specification.
-The matched host name is usually the one given on the command line
-(see the
-.Cm CanonicalizeHostname
-option for exceptions).
-.Pp
-Since the first obtained value for each parameter is used, more
-host-specific declarations should be given near the beginning of the
-file, and general defaults at the end.
-.Pp
-The file contains keyword-argument pairs, one per line.
-Lines starting with
-.Ql #
-and empty lines are interpreted as comments.
-Arguments may optionally be enclosed in double quotes
-.Pq \&"
-in order to represent arguments containing spaces.
-Configuration options may be separated by whitespace or
-optional whitespace and exactly one
-.Ql = ;
-the latter format is useful to avoid the need to quote whitespace
-when specifying configuration options using the
-.Nm ssh ,
-.Nm scp ,
-and
-.Nm sftp
-.Fl o
-option.
-.Pp
-The possible
-keywords and their meanings are as follows (note that
-keywords are case-insensitive and arguments are case-sensitive):
-.Bl -tag -width Ds
-.It Cm Host
-Restricts the following declarations (up to the next
-.Cm Host
-or
-.Cm Match
-keyword) to be only for those hosts that match one of the patterns
-given after the keyword.
-If more than one pattern is provided, they should be separated by whitespace.
-A single
-.Ql *
-as a pattern can be used to provide global
-defaults for all hosts.
-The host is usually the
-.Ar hostname
-argument given on the command line
-(see the
-.Cm CanonicalizeHostname
-keyword for exceptions).
-.Pp
-A pattern entry may be negated by prefixing it with an exclamation mark
-.Pq Sq !\& .
-If a negated entry is matched, then the
-.Cm Host
-entry is ignored, regardless of whether any other patterns on the line
-match.
-Negated matches are therefore useful to provide exceptions for wildcard
-matches.
-.Pp
-See
-.Sx PATTERNS
-for more information on patterns.
-.It Cm Match
-Restricts the following declarations (up to the next
-.Cm Host
-or
-.Cm Match
-keyword) to be used only when the conditions following the
-.Cm Match
-keyword are satisfied.
-Match conditions are specified using one or more criteria
-or the single token
-.Cm all
-which always matches.
-The available criteria keywords are:
-.Cm canonical ,
-.Cm exec ,
-.Cm host ,
-.Cm originalhost ,
-.Cm user ,
-and
-.Cm localuser .
-The
-.Cm all
-criteria must appear alone or immediately after
-.Cm canonical .
-Other criteria may be combined arbitrarily.
-All criteria but
-.Cm all
-and
-.Cm canonical
-require an argument.
-Criteria may be negated by prepending an exclamation mark
-.Pq Sq !\& .
-.Pp
-The
-.Cm canonical
-keyword matches only when the configuration file is being re-parsed
-after hostname canonicalization (see the
-.Cm CanonicalizeHostname
-option.)
-This may be useful to specify conditions that work with canonical host
-names only.
-The
-.Cm exec
-keyword executes the specified command under the user's shell.
-If the command returns a zero exit status then the condition is considered true.
-Commands containing whitespace characters must be quoted.
-Arguments to
-.Cm exec
-accept the tokens described in the
-.Sx TOKENS
-section.
-.Pp
-The other keywords' criteria must be single entries or comma-separated
-lists and may use the wildcard and negation operators described in the
-.Sx PATTERNS
-section.
-The criteria for the
-.Cm host
-keyword are matched against the target hostname, after any substitution
-by the
-.Cm Hostname
-or
-.Cm CanonicalizeHostname
-options.
-The
-.Cm originalhost
-keyword matches against the hostname as it was specified on the command-line.
-The
-.Cm user
-keyword matches against the target username on the remote host.
-The
-.Cm localuser
-keyword matches against the name of the local user running
-.Xr ssh 1
-(this keyword may be useful in system-wide
-.Nm
-files).
-.It Cm AddKeysToAgent
-Specifies whether keys should be automatically added to a running
-.Xr ssh-agent 1 .
-If this option is set to
-.Cm yes
-and a key is loaded from a file, the key and its passphrase are added to
-the agent with the default lifetime, as if by
-.Xr ssh-add 1 .
-If this option is set to
-.Cm ask ,
-.Xr ssh 1
-will require confirmation using the
-.Ev SSH_ASKPASS
-program before adding a key (see
-.Xr ssh-add 1
-for details).
-If this option is set to
-.Cm confirm ,
-each use of the key must be confirmed, as if the
-.Fl c
-option was specified to
-.Xr ssh-add 1 .
-If this option is set to
-.Cm no ,
-no keys are added to the agent.
-The argument must be
-.Cm yes ,
-.Cm confirm ,
-.Cm ask ,
-or
-.Cm no
-(the default).
-.It Cm AddressFamily
-Specifies which address family to use when connecting.
-Valid arguments are
-.Cm any
-(the default),
-.Cm inet
-(use IPv4 only), or
-.Cm inet6
-(use IPv6 only).
-.It Cm BatchMode
-If set to
-.Cm yes ,
-passphrase/password querying will be disabled.
-This option is useful in scripts and other batch jobs where no user
-is present to supply the password.
-The argument must be
-.Cm yes
-or
-.Cm no
-(the default).
-.It Cm BindAddress
-Use the specified address on the local machine as the source address of
-the connection.
-Only useful on systems with more than one address.
-Note that this option does not work if
-.Cm UsePrivilegedPort
-is set to
-.Cm yes .
-.It Cm CanonicalDomains
-When
-.Cm CanonicalizeHostname
-is enabled, this option specifies the list of domain suffixes in which to
-search for the specified destination host.
-.It Cm CanonicalizeFallbackLocal
-Specifies whether to fail with an error when hostname canonicalization fails.
-The default,
-.Cm yes ,
-will attempt to look up the unqualified hostname using the system resolver's
-search rules.
-A value of
-.Cm no
-will cause
-.Xr ssh 1
-to fail instantly if
-.Cm CanonicalizeHostname
-is enabled and the target hostname cannot be found in any of the domains
-specified by
-.Cm CanonicalDomains .
-.It Cm CanonicalizeHostname
-Controls whether explicit hostname canonicalization is performed.
-The default,
-.Cm no ,
-is not to perform any name rewriting and let the system resolver handle all
-hostname lookups.
-If set to
-.Cm yes
-then, for connections that do not use a
-.Cm ProxyCommand ,
-.Xr ssh 1
-will attempt to canonicalize the hostname specified on the command line
-using the
-.Cm CanonicalDomains
-suffixes and
-.Cm CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs
-rules.
-If
-.Cm CanonicalizeHostname
-is set to
-.Cm always ,
-then canonicalization is applied to proxied connections too.
-.Pp
-If this option is enabled, then the configuration files are processed
-again using the new target name to pick up any new configuration in matching
-.Cm Host
-and
-.Cm Match
-stanzas.
-.It Cm CanonicalizeMaxDots
-Specifies the maximum number of dot characters in a hostname before
-canonicalization is disabled.
-The default, 1,
-allows a single dot (i.e. hostname.subdomain).
-.It Cm CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs
-Specifies rules to determine whether CNAMEs should be followed when
-canonicalizing hostnames.
-The rules consist of one or more arguments of
-.Ar source_domain_list : Ns Ar target_domain_list ,
-where
-.Ar source_domain_list
-is a pattern-list of domains that may follow CNAMEs in canonicalization,
-and
-.Ar target_domain_list
-is a pattern-list of domains that they may resolve to.
-.Pp
-For example,
-.Qq *.a.example.com:*.b.example.com,*.c.example.com
-will allow hostnames matching
-.Qq *.a.example.com
-to be canonicalized to names in the
-.Qq *.b.example.com
-or
-.Qq *.c.example.com
-domains.
-.It Cm CertificateFile
-Specifies a file from which the user's certificate is read.
-A corresponding private key must be provided separately in order
-to use this certificate either
-from an
-.Cm IdentityFile
-directive or
-.Fl i
-flag to
-.Xr ssh 1 ,
-via
-.Xr ssh-agent 1 ,
-or via a
-.Cm PKCS11Provider .
-.Pp
-Arguments to
-.Cm CertificateFile
-may use the tilde syntax to refer to a user's home directory
-or the tokens described in the
-.Sx TOKENS
-section.
-.Pp
-It is possible to have multiple certificate files specified in
-configuration files; these certificates will be tried in sequence.
-Multiple
-.Cm CertificateFile
-directives will add to the list of certificates used for
-authentication.
-.It Cm ChallengeResponseAuthentication
-Specifies whether to use challenge-response authentication.
-The argument to this keyword must be
-.Cm yes
-(the default)
-or
-.Cm no .
-.It Cm CheckHostIP
-If set to
-.Cm yes
-(the default),
-.Xr ssh 1
-will additionally check the host IP address in the
-.Pa known_hosts
-file.
-This allows it to detect if a host key changed due to DNS spoofing
-and will add addresses of destination hosts to
-.Pa ~/.ssh/known_hosts
-in the process, regardless of the setting of
-.Cm StrictHostKeyChecking .
-If the option is set to
-.Cm no ,
-the check will not be executed.
-.It Cm Cipher
-Specifies the cipher to use for encrypting the session
-in protocol version 1.
-Currently,
-.Cm blowfish ,
-.Cm 3des
-(the default),
-and
-.Cm des
-are supported,
-though
-.Cm des
-is only supported in the
-.Xr ssh 1
-client for interoperability with legacy protocol 1 implementations;
-its use is strongly discouraged due to cryptographic weaknesses.
-.It Cm Ciphers
-Specifies the ciphers allowed for protocol version 2
-in order of preference.
-Multiple ciphers must be comma-separated.
-If the specified value begins with a
-.Sq +
-character, then the specified ciphers will be appended to the default set
-instead of replacing them.
-.Pp
-The supported ciphers are:
-.Bd -literal -offset indent
-3des-cbc
-aes128-cbc
-aes192-cbc
-aes256-cbc
-aes128-ctr
-aes192-ctr
-aes256-ctr
-aes128-gcm@openssh.com
-aes256-gcm@openssh.com
-arcfour
-arcfour128
-arcfour256
-blowfish-cbc
-cast128-cbc
-chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com
-.Ed
-.Pp
-The default is:
-.Bd -literal -offset indent
-chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,
-aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,
-aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com,
-aes128-cbc,aes192-cbc,aes256-cbc
-.Ed
-.Pp
-The list of available ciphers may also be obtained using
-.Qq ssh -Q cipher .
-.It Cm ClearAllForwardings
-Specifies that all local, remote, and dynamic port forwardings
-specified in the configuration files or on the command line be
-cleared.
-This option is primarily useful when used from the
-.Xr ssh 1
-command line to clear port forwardings set in
-configuration files, and is automatically set by
-.Xr scp 1
-and
-.Xr sftp 1 .
-The argument must be
-.Cm yes
-or
-.Cm no
-(the default).
-.It Cm Compression
-Specifies whether to use compression.
-The argument must be
-.Cm yes
-or
-.Cm no
-(the default).
-.It Cm CompressionLevel
-Specifies the compression level to use if compression is enabled.
-The argument must be an integer from 1 (fast) to 9 (slow, best).
-The default level is 6, which is good for most applications.
-The meaning of the values is the same as in
-.Xr gzip 1 .
-Note that this option applies to protocol version 1 only.
-.It Cm ConnectionAttempts
-Specifies the number of tries (one per second) to make before exiting.
-The argument must be an integer.
-This may be useful in scripts if the connection sometimes fails.
-The default is 1.
-.It Cm ConnectTimeout
-Specifies the timeout (in seconds) used when connecting to the
-SSH server, instead of using the default system TCP timeout.
-This value is used only when the target is down or really unreachable,
-not when it refuses the connection.
-.It Cm ControlMaster
-Enables the sharing of multiple sessions over a single network connection.
-When set to
-.Cm yes ,
-.Xr ssh 1
-will listen for connections on a control socket specified using the
-.Cm ControlPath
-argument.
-Additional sessions can connect to this socket using the same
-.Cm ControlPath
-with
-.Cm ControlMaster
-set to
-.Cm no
-(the default).
-These sessions will try to reuse the master instance's network connection
-rather than initiating new ones, but will fall back to connecting normally
-if the control socket does not exist, or is not listening.
-.Pp
-Setting this to
-.Cm ask
-will cause
-.Xr ssh 1
-to listen for control connections, but require confirmation using
-.Xr ssh-askpass 1 .
-If the
-.Cm ControlPath
-cannot be opened,
-.Xr ssh 1
-will continue without connecting to a master instance.
-.Pp
-X11 and
-.Xr ssh-agent 1
-forwarding is supported over these multiplexed connections, however the
-display and agent forwarded will be the one belonging to the master
-connection i.e. it is not possible to forward multiple displays or agents.
-.Pp
-Two additional options allow for opportunistic multiplexing: try to use a
-master connection but fall back to creating a new one if one does not already
-exist.
-These options are:
-.Cm auto
-and
-.Cm autoask .
-The latter requires confirmation like the
-.Cm ask
-option.
-.It Cm ControlPath
-Specify the path to the control socket used for connection sharing as described
-in the
-.Cm ControlMaster
-section above or the string
-.Cm none
-to disable connection sharing.
-Arguments to
-.Cm ControlPath
-may use the tilde syntax to refer to a user's home directory
-or the tokens described in the
-.Sx TOKENS
-section.
-It is recommended that any
-.Cm ControlPath
-used for opportunistic connection sharing include
-at least %h, %p, and %r (or alternatively %C) and be placed in a directory
-that is not writable by other users.
-This ensures that shared connections are uniquely identified.
-.It Cm ControlPersist
-When used in conjunction with
-.Cm ControlMaster ,
-specifies that the master connection should remain open
-in the background (waiting for future client connections)
-after the initial client connection has been closed.
-If set to
-.Cm no ,
-then the master connection will not be placed into the background,
-and will close as soon as the initial client connection is closed.
-If set to
-.Cm yes
-or 0,
-then the master connection will remain in the background indefinitely
-(until killed or closed via a mechanism such as the
-.Qq ssh -O exit ) .
-If set to a time in seconds, or a time in any of the formats documented in
-.Xr sshd_config 5 ,
-then the backgrounded master connection will automatically terminate
-after it has remained idle (with no client connections) for the
-specified time.
-.It Cm DynamicForward
-Specifies that a TCP port on the local machine be forwarded
-over the secure channel, and the application
-protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the
-remote machine.
-.Pp
-The argument must be
-.Sm off
-.Oo Ar bind_address : Oc Ar port .
-.Sm on
-IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing addresses in square brackets.
-By default, the local port is bound in accordance with the
-.Cm GatewayPorts
-setting.
-However, an explicit
-.Ar bind_address
-may be used to bind the connection to a specific address.
-The
-.Ar bind_address
-of
-.Cm localhost
-indicates that the listening port be bound for local use only, while an
-empty address or
-.Sq *
-indicates that the port should be available from all interfaces.
-.Pp
-Currently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and
-.Xr ssh 1
-will act as a SOCKS server.
-Multiple forwardings may be specified, and
-additional forwardings can be given on the command line.
-Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.
-.It Cm EnableSSHKeysign
-Setting this option to
-.Cm yes
-in the global client configuration file
-.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_config
-enables the use of the helper program
-.Xr ssh-keysign 8
-during
-.Cm HostbasedAuthentication .
-The argument must be
-.Cm yes
-or
-.Cm no
-(the default).
-This option should be placed in the non-hostspecific section.
-See
-.Xr ssh-keysign 8
-for more information.
-.It Cm EscapeChar
-Sets the escape character (default:
-.Ql ~ ) .
-The escape character can also
-be set on the command line.
-The argument should be a single character,
-.Ql ^
-followed by a letter, or
-.Cm none
-to disable the escape
-character entirely (making the connection transparent for binary
-data).
-.It Cm ExitOnForwardFailure
-Specifies whether
-.Xr ssh 1
-should terminate the connection if it cannot set up all requested
-dynamic, tunnel, local, and remote port forwardings, (e.g.\&
-if either end is unable to bind and listen on a specified port).
-Note that
-.Cm ExitOnForwardFailure
-does not apply to connections made over port forwardings and will not,
-for example, cause
-.Xr ssh 1
-to exit if TCP connections to the ultimate forwarding destination fail.
-The argument must be
-.Cm yes
-or
-.Cm no
-(the default).
-.It Cm FingerprintHash
-Specifies the hash algorithm used when displaying key fingerprints.
-Valid options are:
-.Cm md5
-and
-.Cm sha256
-(the default).
-.It Cm ForwardAgent
-Specifies whether the connection to the authentication agent (if any)
-will be forwarded to the remote machine.
-The argument must be
-.Cm yes
-or
-.Cm no
-(the default).
-.Pp
-Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution.
-Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host
-(for the agent's Unix-domain socket)
-can access the local agent through the forwarded connection.
-An attacker cannot obtain key material from the agent,
-however they can perform operations on the keys that enable them to
-authenticate using the identities loaded into the agent.
-.It Cm ForwardX11
-Specifies whether X11 connections will be automatically redirected
-over the secure channel and
-.Ev DISPLAY
-set.
-The argument must be
-.Cm yes
-or
-.Cm no
-(the default).
-.Pp
-X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution.
-Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host
-(for the user's X11 authorization database)
-can access the local X11 display through the forwarded connection.
-An attacker may then be able to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring
-if the

-.Pp
-If the
-.Ar bind_address
-is not specified, the default is to only bind to loopback addresses.
-If the
-.Ar bind_address
-is
-.Ql *
-or an empty string, then the forwarding is requested to listen on all
-interfaces.
-Specifying a remote
-.Ar bind_address

-for more information on patterns.
-.It Cm ServerAliveCountMax
-Sets the number of server alive messages (see below) which may be
-sent without
-.Xr ssh 1
-receiving any messages back from the server.
-If this threshold is reached while server alive messages are being sent,
-ssh will disconnect from the server, terminating the session.
-It is important to note that the use of server alive messages is very
-different from
-.Cm TCPKeepAlive
-(below).
-The server alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel
-and therefore will not be spoofable.
-The TCP keepalive option enabled by
-.Cm TCPKeepAlive
-is spoofable.
-The server alive mechanism is valuable when the client or
-server depend on knowing when a connection has become inactive.
-.Pp
-The default value is 3.
-If, for example,
-.Cm ServerAliveInterval
-(see below) is set to 15 and
-.Cm ServerAliveCountMax
-is left at the default, if the server becomes unresponsive,
-ssh will disconnect after approximately 45 seconds.

-readable and writable only by the owner.
-Note that not all operating systems honor the file mode on Unix-domain
-socket files.
-.It Cm StreamLocalBindUnlink
-Specifies whether to remove an existing Unix-domain socket file for local
-or remote port forwarding before creating a new one.
-If the socket file already exists and
-.Cm StreamLocalBindUnlink
-is not enabled,
-.Nm ssh
-will be unable to forward the port to the Unix-domain socket file.
-This option is only used for port forwarding to a Unix-domain socket file.
-.Pp
-The argument must be
-.Cm yes
-or
-.Cm no
-(the default).
-.It Cm StrictHostKeyChecking
-If this flag is set to
-.Cm yes ,
-.Xr ssh 1
-will never automatically add host keys to the
-.Pa ~/.ssh/known_hosts
-file, and refuses to connect to hosts whose host key has changed.
-This provides maximum protection against trojan horse attacks,
-though it can be annoying when the
-.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts
-file is poorly maintained or when connections to new hosts are
-frequently made.
-This option forces the user to manually
-add all new hosts.
-If this flag is set to
-.Cm no ,
-ssh will automatically add new host keys to the
-user known hosts files.
-If this flag is set to
-.Cm ask
-(the default),
-new host keys
-will be added to the user known host files only after the user
-has confirmed that is what they really want to do, and
-ssh will refuse to connect to hosts whose host key has changed.
-The host keys of
-known hosts will be verified automatically in all cases.
-.It Cm TCPKeepAlive
-Specifies whether the system should send TCP keepalive messages to the
-other side.
-If they are sent, death of the connection or crash of one
-of the machines will be properly noticed.
-However, this means that
-connections will die if the route is down temporarily, and some people
-find it annoying.
-.Pp
-The default is
-.Cm yes
-(to send TCP keepalive messages), and the client will notice
-if the network goes down or the remote host dies.
-This is important in scripts, and many users want it too.
-.Pp
-To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should be set to
-.Cm no .
-.It Cm Tunnel
-Request
-.Xr tun 4
-device forwarding between the client and the server.
-The argument must be
-.Cm yes ,
-.Cm point-to-point
-(layer 3),

-Specifying
-.Cm yes
-requests the default tunnel mode, which is
-.Cm point-to-point .
-.It Cm TunnelDevice
-Specifies the

-devices to open on the client
-.Pq Ar local_tun
-and the server
-.Pq Ar remote_tun .
-.Pp
-The argument must be
-.Sm off
-.Ar local_tun Op : Ar remote_tun .
-.Sm on
-The devices may be specified by numerical ID or the keyword
-.Cm any ,
-which uses the next available tunnel device.
-If
-.Ar remote_tun
-is not specified, it defaults to
-.Cm any .
-The default is
-.Cm any:any .
-.It Cm UpdateHostKeys
-Specifies whether
-.Xr ssh 1
-should accept notifications of additional hostkeys from the server sent
-after authentication has completed and add them to
-.Cm UserKnownHostsFile .
-The argument must be
-.Cm yes ,
-.Cm no
-(the default) or
-.Cm ask .
-Enabling this option allows learning alternate hostkeys for a server
-and supports graceful key rotation by allowing a server to send replacement
-public keys before old ones are removed.
-Additional hostkeys are only accepted if the key used to authenticate the
-host was already trusted or explicitly accepted by the user.
-If
-.Cm UpdateHostKeys
-is set to
-.Cm ask ,
-then the user is asked to confirm the modifications to the known_hosts file.
-Confirmation is currently incompatible with

-Specifies whether to use a privileged port for outgoing connections.
-The argument must be
-.Cm yes
-or
-.Cm no
-(the default).
-If set to
-.Cm yes ,
-.Xr ssh 1
-must be setuid root.
-Note that this option must be set to
-.Cm yes
-for
-.Cm RhostsRSAAuthentication
-with older servers.
-.It Cm User
-Specifies the user to log in as.
-This can be useful when a different user name is used on different machines.
-This saves the trouble of
-having to remember to give the user name on the command line.
-.It Cm UserKnownHostsFile
-Specifies one or more files to use for the user
-host key database, separated by whitespace.
-The default is
-.Pa ~/.ssh/known_hosts ,
-.Pa ~/.ssh/known_hosts2 .
-.It Cm VerifyHostKeyDNS
-Specifies whether to verify the remote key using DNS and SSHFP resource
-records.
-If this option is set to
-.Cm yes ,
-the client will implicitly trust keys that match a secure fingerprint
-from DNS.
-Insecure fingerprints will be handled as if this option was set to
-.Cm ask .
-If this option is set to
-.Cm ask ,
-information on fingerprint match will be displayed, but the user will still
-need to confirm new host keys according to the
-.Cm StrictHostKeyChecking
-option.
-The default is

-.It Cm VisualHostKey
-If this flag is set to
-.Cm yes ,
-an ASCII art representation of the remote host key fingerprint is
-printed in addition to the fingerprint string at login and
-for unknown host keys.
-If this flag is set to
-.Cm no
-(the default),
-no fingerprint strings are printed at login and
-only the fingerprint string will be printed for unknown host keys.
-.It Cm XAuthLocation
-Specifies the full pathname of the
-.Xr xauth 1
-program.
-The default is

-.Sh PATTERNS
-A
-.Em pattern
-consists of zero or more non-whitespace characters,
-.Sq *
-(a wildcard that matches zero or more characters),
-or
-.Sq ?\&
-(a wildcard that matches exactly one character).
-For example, to specify a set of declarations for any host in the

+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+.Nm
+(OpenSSH Daemon) is the daemon program for
+.Xr ssh 1 .
+Together these programs replace rlogin and rsh,
+and provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts
+over an insecure network.
+.Pp
+.Nm
+listens for connections from clients.
+It is normally started at boot by
+.Xr smf 5 .
+It forks a new
+daemon for each incoming connection.
+The forked daemons handle
+key exchange, encryption, authentication, command execution,
+and data exchange.
+.Pp
+.Nm
+can be configured using command-line options or a configuration file
+(by default
+.Xr sshd_config 4 ) ;
+command-line options override values specified in the
+configuration file.
+.Nm
+rereads its configuration file when it receives a hangup signal,
+.Dv SIGHUP ,
+by executing itself with the name and options it was started with, e.g.\&
+.Pa /usr/sbin/sshd .
+.Pp
+The options are as follows:
+.Bl -tag -width Ds
+.It Fl 4
+Forces
+.Nm
+to use IPv4 addresses only.
+.It Fl 6
+Forces
+.Nm
+to use IPv6 addresses only.
+.It Fl C Ar connection_spec
+Specify the connection parameters to use for the
+.Fl T
+extended test mode.
+If provided, any
+.Cm Match
+directives in the configuration file
+that would apply to the specified user, host, and address will be set before
+the configuration is written to standard output.
+The connection parameters are supplied as keyword=value pairs.
+The keywords are
+.Dq user ,
+.Dq host ,
+.Dq laddr ,
+.Dq lport ,
+and
+.Dq addr .
+All are required and may be supplied in any order, either with multiple
+.Fl C
+options or as a comma-separated list.
+.It Fl c Ar host_certificate_file
+Specifies a path to a certificate file to identify
+.Nm
+during key exchange.
+The certificate file must match a host key file specified using the
+.Fl h
+option or the
+.Cm HostKey
+configuration directive.
+.It Fl D
+When this option is specified,
+.Nm
+will not detach and does not become a daemon.
+This allows easy monitoring of
+.Nm sshd .
+.It Fl d
+Debug mode.
+The server sends verbose debug output to standard error,
+and does not put itself in the background.
+The server also will not fork and will only process one connection.
+This option is only intended for debugging for the server.
+Multiple
+.Fl d
+options increase the debugging level.
+Maximum is 3.
+.It Fl E Ar log_file
+Append debug logs to
+.Ar log_file
+instead of the system log.
+.It Fl e
+Write debug logs to standard error instead of the system log.
+.It Fl f Ar config_file
+Specifies the name of the configuration file.
+The default is
+.Pa /etc/ssh/sshd_config .
+.Nm
+refuses to start if there is no configuration file.
+.It Fl g Ar login_grace_time
+Gives the grace time for clients to authenticate themselves (default
+120 seconds).
+If the client fails to authenticate the user within
+this many seconds, the server disconnects and exits.
+A value of zero indicates no limit.
+.It Fl h Ar host_key_file
+Specifies a file from which a host key is read.
+This option must be given if
+.Nm
+is not run as root (as the normal
+host key files are normally not readable by anyone but root).
+The default is
+.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key ,
+.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key ,
+.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
+and
+.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key .
+It is possible to have multiple host key files for
+the different host key algorithms.
+.It Fl i
+Specifies that
+.Nm
+is being run from
+.Xr inetd 8 .
+.It Fl o Ar option
+Can be used to give options in the format used in the configuration file.
+This is useful for specifying options for which there is no separate
+command-line flag.
+For full details of the options, and their values, see
+.Xr sshd_config 4 .
+.It Fl p Ar port
+Specifies the port on which the server listens for connections
+(default 22).
+Multiple port options are permitted.
+Ports specified in the configuration file with the
+.Cm Port
+option are ignored when a command-line port is specified.
+Ports specified using the
+.Cm ListenAddress
+option override command-line ports.
+.It Fl q
+Quiet mode.
+Nothing is sent to the system log.
+Normally the beginning,
+authentication, and termination of each connection is logged.
+.It Fl T
+Extended test mode.
+Check the validity of the configuration file, output the effective configuration
+to stdout and then exit.
+Optionally,
+.Cm Match
+rules may be applied by specifying the connection parameters using one or more
+.Fl C
+options.
+.It Fl t
+Test mode.
+Only check the validity of the configuration file and sanity of the keys.
+This is useful for updating
+.Nm
+reliably as configuration options may change.
+.It Fl u Ar len
+This option is used to specify the size of the field
+in the
+.Li utmp
+structure that holds the remote host name.
+If the resolved host name is longer than
+.Ar len ,
+the dotted decimal value will be used instead.
+This allows hosts with very long host names that
+overflow this field to still be uniquely identified.
+Specifying
+.Fl u0
+indicates that only dotted decimal addresses
+should be put into the
+.Pa utmp
+file.
+.Fl u0
+may also be used to prevent
+.Nm
+from making DNS requests unless the authentication
+mechanism or configuration requires it.
+Authentication mechanisms that may require DNS include
+.Cm HostbasedAuthentication
+and using a
+.Cm from="pattern-list"
+option in a key file.
+Configuration options that require DNS include using a
+USER@HOST pattern in
+.Cm AllowUsers
+or
+.Cm DenyUsers .
+.El
+.Sh AUTHENTICATION
+The OpenSSH SSH daemon supports SSH protocol 2 only.
+Each host has a host-specific key,
+used to identify the host.
+Whenever a client connects, the daemon responds with its public
+host key.
+The client compares the
+host key against its own database to verify that it has not changed.
+Forward security is provided through a Diffie-Hellman key agreement.
+This key agreement results in a shared session key.
+The rest of the session is encrypted using a symmetric cipher, currently
+128-bit AES, Blowfish, 3DES, CAST128, Arcfour, 192-bit AES, or 256-bit AES.
+The client selects the encryption algorithm
+to use from those offered by the server.
+Additionally, session integrity is provided
+through a cryptographic message authentication code
+(hmac-md5, hmac-sha1, umac-64, umac-128, hmac-ripemd160,
+hmac-sha2-256 or hmac-sha2-512).
+.Pp
+Finally, the server and the client enter an authentication dialog.
+The client tries to authenticate itself using
+host-based authentication,
+public key authentication,
+challenge-response authentication,
+or password authentication.
+.Pp
+Regardless of the authentication type, the account is checked to
+ensure that it is accessible.  An account is not accessible if it is
+locked, listed in
+.Cm DenyUsers
+or its group is listed in
+.Cm DenyGroups
+\&.  The definition of a locked account is system dependant. Some platforms
+have their own account database (eg AIX) and some modify the passwd field (
+.Ql \&*LK\&*
+on Solaris and UnixWare,
+.Ql \&*
+on HP-UX, containing
+.Ql Nologin
+on Tru64,
+a leading
+.Ql \&*LOCKED\&*
+on FreeBSD and a leading
+.Ql \&!
+on most Linuxes).
+If there is a requirement to disable password authentication
+for the account while allowing still public-key, then the passwd field
+should be set to something other than these values (eg
+.Ql NP
+or
+.Ql \&*NP\&*
+).
+.Pp
+If the client successfully authenticates itself, a dialog for
+preparing the session is entered.
+At this time the client may request
+things like allocating a pseudo-tty, forwarding X11 connections,
+forwarding TCP connections, or forwarding the authentication agent
+connection over the secure channel.
+.Pp
+After this, the client either requests a shell or execution of a command.
+The sides then enter session mode.
+In this mode, either side may send
+data at any time, and such data is forwarded to/from the shell or
+command on the server side, and the user terminal in the client side.
+.Pp
+When the user program terminates and all forwarded X11 and other
+connections have been closed, the server sends command exit status to
+the client, and both sides exit.
+.Sh LOGIN PROCESS
+When a user successfully logs in,
+.Nm
+does the following:
+.Bl -enum -offset indent
+.It
+If the login is on a tty, and no command has been specified,
+prints last login time and
+.Pa /etc/motd
+(unless prevented in the configuration file or by
+.Pa ~/.hushlogin ;
+see the
+.Sx FILES
+section).
+.It
+If the login is on a tty, records login time.
+.It
+Checks
+.Pa /etc/nologin ;
+if it exists, prints contents and quits
+(unless root).
+.It
+Changes to run with normal user privileges.
+.It
+Sets up basic environment.
+.It
+Reads the file
+.Pa ~/.ssh/environment ,
+if it exists, and users are allowed to change their environment.
+See the
+.Cm PermitUserEnvironment
+option in
+.Xr sshd_config 4 .
+.It
+Changes to user's home directory.
+.It
+If
+.Pa ~/.ssh/rc
+exists and the
+.Xr sshd_config 4
+.Cm PermitUserRC
+option is set, runs it; else if
+.Pa /etc/ssh/sshrc
+exists, runs
+it; otherwise runs xauth.
+The
+.Dq rc
+files are given the X11
+authentication protocol and cookie in standard input.
+See
+.Sx SSHRC ,
+below.
+.It
+Runs user's shell or command.
+All commands are run under the user's login shell as specified in the
+system password database.
+.El
+.Sh SSHRC
+If the file
+.Pa ~/.ssh/rc
+exists,
+.Xr sh 1
+runs it after reading the
+environment files but before starting the user's shell or command.
+It must not produce any output on stdout; stderr must be used
+instead.
+If X11 forwarding is in use, it will receive the "proto cookie" pair in
+its standard input (and
+.Ev DISPLAY
+in its environment).
+The script must call
+.Xr xauth 1
+because
+.Nm
+will not run xauth automatically to add X11 cookies.
+.Pp
+The primary purpose of this file is to run any initialization routines
+which may be needed before the user's home directory becomes
+accessible; AFS is a particular example of such an environment.
+.Pp
+This file will probably contain some initialization code followed by
+something similar to:
+.Bd -literal -offset 3n
+if read proto cookie && [ -n "$DISPLAY" ]; then
+	if [ `echo $DISPLAY | cut -c1-10` = 'localhost:' ]; then
+		# X11UseLocalhost=yes
+		echo add unix:`echo $DISPLAY |
+		    cut -c11-` $proto $cookie
+	else
+		# X11UseLocalhost=no
+		echo add $DISPLAY $proto $cookie
+	fi | xauth -q -
+fi
+.Ed
+.Pp
+If this file does not exist,
+.Pa /etc/ssh/sshrc
+is run, and if that
+does not exist either, xauth is used to add the cookie.
+.Sh AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE FORMAT
+.Cm AuthorizedKeysFile
+specifies the files containing public keys for
+public key authentication;
+if this option is not specified, the default is
+.Pa ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
+and
+.Pa ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 .
+Each line of the file contains one
+key (empty lines and lines starting with a
+.Ql #
+are ignored as
+comments).
+Public keys consist of the following space-separated fields:
+options, keytype, base64-encoded key, comment.
+The options field is optional.
+The keytype is
+.Dq ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 ,
+.Dq ecdsa-sha2-nistp384 ,
+.Dq ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 ,
+.Dq ssh-ed25519 ,
+.Dq ssh-dss
+or
+.Dq ssh-rsa ;
+the comment field is not used for anything (but may be convenient for the
+user to identify the key).
+.Pp
+Note that lines in this file can be several hundred bytes long
+(because of the size of the public key encoding) up to a limit of
+8 kilobytes, which permits DSA keys up to 8 kilobits and RSA
+keys up to 16 kilobits.
+You don't want to type them in; instead, copy the
+.Pa id_dsa.pub ,
+.Pa id_ecdsa.pub ,
+.Pa id_ed25519.pub ,
+or the
+.Pa id_rsa.pub
+file and edit it.
+.Pp
+.Nm
+enforces a minimum RSA key modulus size of 768 bits.
+.Pp
+The options (if present) consist of comma-separated option
+specifications.
+No spaces are permitted, except within double quotes.
+The following option specifications are supported (note
+that option keywords are case-insensitive):
+.Bl -tag -width Ds
+.It Cm agent-forwarding
+Enable authentication agent forwarding previously disabled by the
+.Cm restrict
+option.
+.It Cm cert-authority
+Specifies that the listed key is a certification authority (CA) that is
+trusted to validate signed certificates for user authentication.
+.Pp
+Certificates may encode access restrictions similar to these key options.
+If both certificate restrictions and key options are present, the most
+restrictive union of the two is applied.
+.It Cm command="command"
+Specifies that the command is executed whenever this key is used for
+authentication.
+The command supplied by the user (if any) is ignored.
+The command is run on a pty if the client requests a pty;
+otherwise it is run without a tty.
+If an 8-bit clean channel is required,
+one must not request a pty or should specify
+.Cm no-pty .
+A quote may be included in the command by quoting it with a backslash.
+.Pp
+This option might be useful
+to restrict certain public keys to perform just a specific operation.
+An example might be a key that permits remote backups but nothing else.
+Note that the client may specify TCP and/or X11
+forwarding unless they are explicitly prohibited, e.g. using the
+.Cm restrict
+key option.
+.Pp
+The command originally supplied by the client is available in the
+.Ev SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND
+environment variable.
+Note that this option applies to shell, command or subsystem execution.
+Also note that this command may be superseded by a
+.Xr sshd_config 4
+.Cm ForceCommand
+directive.
+.Pp
+If a command is specified and a forced-command is embedded in a certificate
+used for authentication, then the certificate will be accepted only if the
+two commands are identical.
+.It Cm environment="NAME=value"
+Specifies that the string is to be added to the environment when
+logging in using this key.
+Environment variables set this way
+override other default environment values.
+Multiple options of this type are permitted.
+Environment processing is disabled by default and is
+controlled via the
+.Cm PermitUserEnvironment
+option.
+.It Cm from="pattern-list"
+Specifies that in addition to public key authentication, either the canonical
+name of the remote host or its IP address must be present in the
+comma-separated list of patterns.
+See PATTERNS in
+.Xr ssh_config 4
+for more information on patterns.
+.Pp
+In addition to the wildcard matching that may be applied to hostnames or
+addresses, a
+.Cm from
+stanza may match IP addresses using CIDR address/masklen notation.
+.Pp
+The purpose of this option is to optionally increase security: public key
+authentication by itself does not trust the network or name servers or
+anything (but the key); however, if somebody somehow steals the key, the key
+permits an intruder to log in from anywhere in the world.
+This additional option makes using a stolen key more difficult (name
+servers and/or routers would have to be compromised in addition to
+just the key).
+.It Cm no-agent-forwarding
+Forbids authentication agent forwarding when this key is used for
+authentication.
+.It Cm no-port-forwarding
+Forbids TCP forwarding when this key is used for authentication.
+Any port forward requests by the client will return an error.
+This might be used, e.g. in connection with the
+.Cm command
+option.
+.It Cm no-pty
+Prevents tty allocation (a request to allocate a pty will fail).
+.It Cm no-user-rc
+Disables execution of
+.Pa ~/.ssh/rc .
+.It Cm no-X11-forwarding
+Forbids X11 forwarding when this key is used for authentication.
+Any X11 forward requests by the client will return an error.
+.It Cm permitopen="host:port"
+Limit local port forwarding with
+.Xr ssh 1
+.Fl L
+such that it may only connect to the specified host and port.
+IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in square brackets.
+Multiple
+.Cm permitopen
+options may be applied separated by commas.
+No pattern matching is performed on the specified hostnames,
+they must be literal domains or addresses.
+A port specification of
+.Cm *
+matches any port.
+.It Cm port-forwarding
+Enable port forwarding previously disabled by the
+.Cm restrict
+.It Cm principals="principals"
+On a
+.Cm cert-authority
+line, specifies allowed principals for certificate authentication as a
+comma-separated list.
+At least one name from the list must appear in the certificate's
+list of principals for the certificate to be accepted.
+This option is ignored for keys that are not marked as trusted certificate
+signers using the
+.Cm cert-authority

+.Sh SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS FILE FORMAT
+The
+.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts
+and
+.Pa ~/.ssh/known_hosts
+files contain host public keys for all known hosts.
+The global file should
+be prepared by the administrator (optional), and the per-user file is
+maintained automatically: whenever the user connects from an unknown host,
+its key is added to the per-user file.
+.Pp
+Each line in these files contains the following fields: markers (optional),
+hostnames, keytype, base64-encoded key, comment.
+The fields are separated by spaces.
+.Pp
+The marker is optional, but if it is present then it must be one of
+.Dq @cert-authority ,
+to indicate that the line contains a certification authority (CA) key,
+or
+.Dq @revoked ,
+to indicate that the key contained on the line is revoked and must not ever
+be accepted.
+Only one marker should be used on a key line.
+.Pp
+Hostnames is a comma-separated list of patterns
+.Pf ( Ql *
+and
+.Ql \&?
+act as
+wildcards); each pattern in turn is matched against the canonical host
+name (when authenticating a client) or against the user-supplied
+name (when authenticating a server).
+A pattern may also be preceded by
+.Ql \&!
+to indicate negation: if the host name matches a negated
+pattern, it is not accepted (by that line) even if it matched another
+pattern on the line.
+A hostname or address may optionally be enclosed within
+.Ql \&[
+and
+.Ql \&]
+brackets then followed by
+.Ql \&:
+and a non-standard port number.
+.Pp
+Alternately, hostnames may be stored in a hashed form which hides host names
+and addresses should the file's contents be disclosed.
+Hashed hostnames start with a
+.Ql |
+character.
+Only one hashed hostname may appear on a single line and none of the above
+negation or wildcard operators may be applied.
+.Pp
+The keytype and base64-encoded key are taken directly from the host key; they
+can be obtained, for example, from
+.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub .
+The optional comment field continues to the end of the line, and is not used.
+.Pp
+Lines starting with
+.Ql #
+and empty lines are ignored as comments.
+.Pp
+When performing host authentication, authentication is accepted if any
+matching line has the proper key; either one that matches exactly or,
+if the server has presented a certificate for authentication, the key
+of the certification authority that signed the certificate.
+For a key to be trusted as a certification authority, it must use the
+.Dq @cert-authority
+marker described above.
+.Pp
+The known hosts file also provides a facility to mark keys as revoked,
+for example when it is known that the associated private key has been
+stolen.
+Revoked keys are specified by including the
+.Dq @revoked
+marker at the beginning of the key line, and are never accepted for
+authentication or as certification authorities, but instead will
+produce a warning from
+.Xr ssh 1
+when they are encountered.
+.Pp
+It is permissible (but not
+recommended) to have several lines or different host keys for the same
+names.
+This will inevitably happen when short forms of host names
+from different domains are put in the file.
+It is possible
+that the files contain conflicting information; authentication is
+accepted if valid information can be found from either file.
+.Pp
+Note that the lines in these files are typically hundreds of characters
+long, and you definitely don't want to type in the host keys by hand.
+Rather, generate them by a script,
+.Xr ssh-keyscan 1
+or by taking, for example,
+.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
+and adding the host names at the front.
+.Xr ssh-keygen 1
+also offers some basic automated editing for
+.Pa ~/.ssh/known_hosts
+including removing hosts matching a host name and converting all host
+names to their hashed representations.

-.Sh DESCRIPTION
-.Nm
-(OpenSSH Daemon) is the daemon program for
-.Xr ssh 1 .
-Together these programs replace rlogin and rsh,
-and provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts
-over an insecure network.
-.Pp
-.Nm
-listens for connections from clients.
-It is normally started at boot from
-.Pa /etc/rc .
-It forks a new
-daemon for each incoming connection.
-The forked daemons handle
-key exchange, encryption, authentication, command execution,
-and data exchange.
-.Pp
-.Nm
-can be configured using command-line options or a configuration file
-(by default
-.Xr sshd_config 5 ) ;
-command-line options override values specified in the
-configuration file.
-.Nm
-rereads its configuration file when it receives a hangup signal,
-.Dv SIGHUP ,
-by executing itself with the name and options it was started with, e.g.\&
-.Pa /usr/sbin/sshd .
-.Pp
-The options are as follows:
-.Bl -tag -width Ds
-.It Fl 4
-Forces
-.Nm
-to use IPv4 addresses only.
-.It Fl 6
-Forces
-.Nm
-to use IPv6 addresses only.
-.It Fl C Ar connection_spec
-Specify the connection parameters to use for the
-.Fl T
-extended test mode.
-If provided, any
-.Cm Match
-directives in the configuration file
-that would apply to the specified user, host, and address will be set before
-the configuration is written to standard output.
-The connection parameters are supplied as keyword=value pairs.
-The keywords are
-.Dq user ,
-.Dq host ,
-.Dq laddr ,
-.Dq lport ,
-and
-.Dq addr .
-All are required and may be supplied in any order, either with multiple
-.Fl C
-options or as a comma-separated list.
-.It Fl c Ar host_certificate_file
-Specifies a path to a certificate file to identify
-.Nm
-during key exchange.
-The certificate file must match a host key file specified using the
-.Fl h
-option or the
-.Cm HostKey
-configuration directive.
-.It Fl D
-When this option is specified,
-.Nm
-will not detach and does not become a daemon.
-This allows easy monitoring of
-.Nm sshd .
-.It Fl d
-Debug mode.
-The server sends verbose debug output to standard error,
-and does not put itself in the background.
-The server also will not fork and will only process one connection.
-This option is only intended for debugging for the server.
-Multiple
-.Fl d
-options increase the debugging level.
-Maximum is 3.
-.It Fl E Ar log_file
-Append debug logs to
-.Ar log_file
-instead of the system log.
-.It Fl e
-Write debug logs to standard error instead of the system log.
-.It Fl f Ar config_file
-Specifies the name of the configuration file.
-The default is
-.Pa /etc/ssh/sshd_config .
-.Nm
-refuses to start if there is no configuration file.
-.It Fl g Ar login_grace_time
-Gives the grace time for clients to authenticate themselves (default
-120 seconds).
-If the client fails to authenticate the user within
-this many seconds, the server disconnects and exits.
-A value of zero indicates no limit.
-.It Fl h Ar host_key_file
-Specifies a file from which a host key is read.
-This option must be given if
-.Nm
-is not run as root (as the normal
-host key files are normally not readable by anyone but root).
-The default is
-.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key ,
-.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key ,
-.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
-and
-.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key .
-It is possible to have multiple host key files for
-the different host key algorithms.
-.It Fl i
-Specifies that
-.Nm
-is being run from
-.Xr inetd 8 .
-.It Fl o Ar option
-Can be used to give options in the format used in the configuration file.
-This is useful for specifying options for which there is no separate
-command-line flag.
-For full details of the options, and their values, see
-.Xr sshd_config 5 .
-.It Fl p Ar port
-Specifies the port on which the server listens for connections
-(default 22).
-Multiple port options are permitted.
-Ports specified in the configuration file with the
-.Cm Port
-option are ignored when a command-line port is specified.
-Ports specified using the
-.Cm ListenAddress
-option override command-line ports.
-.It Fl q
-Quiet mode.
-Nothing is sent to the system log.
-Normally the beginning,
-authentication, and termination of each connection is logged.
-.It Fl T
-Extended test mode.
-Check the validity of the configuration file, output the effective configuration
-to stdout and then exit.
-Optionally,
-.Cm Match
-rules may be applied by specifying the connection parameters using one or more
-.Fl C
-options.
-.It Fl t
-Test mode.
-Only check the validity of the configuration file and sanity of the keys.
-This is useful for updating
-.Nm
-reliably as configuration options may change.
-.It Fl u Ar len
-This option is used to specify the size of the field
-in the
-.Li utmp
-structure that holds the remote host name.
-If the resolved host name is longer than
-.Ar len ,
-the dotted decimal value will be used instead.
-This allows hosts with very long host names that
-overflow this field to still be uniquely identified.
-Specifying
-.Fl u0
-indicates that only dotted decimal addresses
-should be put into the
-.Pa utmp
-file.
-.Fl u0
-may also be used to prevent
-.Nm
-from making DNS requests unless the authentication
-mechanism or configuration requires it.
-Authentication mechanisms that may require DNS include
-.Cm HostbasedAuthentication
-and using a
-.Cm from="pattern-list"
-option in a key file.
-Configuration options that require DNS include using a
-USER@HOST pattern in
-.Cm AllowUsers
-or
-.Cm DenyUsers .
-.El
-.Sh AUTHENTICATION
-The OpenSSH SSH daemon supports SSH protocol 2 only.
-Each host has a host-specific key,
-used to identify the host.
-Whenever a client connects, the daemon responds with its public
-host key.
-The client compares the
-host key against its own database to verify that it has not changed.
-Forward security is provided through a Diffie-Hellman key agreement.
-This key agreement results in a shared session key.
-The rest of the session is encrypted using a symmetric cipher, currently
-128-bit AES, Blowfish, 3DES, CAST128, Arcfour, 192-bit AES, or 256-bit AES.
-The client selects the encryption algorithm
-to use from those offered by the server.
-Additionally, session integrity is provided
-through a cryptographic message authentication code
-(hmac-md5, hmac-sha1, umac-64, umac-128, hmac-ripemd160,
-hmac-sha2-256 or hmac-sha2-512).
-.Pp
-Finally, the server and the client enter an authentication dialog.
-The client tries to authenticate itself using
-host-based authentication,
-public key authentication,
-challenge-response authentication,
-or password authentication.
-.Pp
-Regardless of the authentication type, the account is checked to
-ensure that it is accessible.  An account is not accessible if it is
-locked, listed in
-.Cm DenyUsers
-or its group is listed in
-.Cm DenyGroups
-\&.  The definition of a locked account is system dependant. Some platforms
-have their own account database (eg AIX) and some modify the passwd field (
-.Ql \&*LK\&*
-on Solaris and UnixWare,
-.Ql \&*
-on HP-UX, containing
-.Ql Nologin
-on Tru64,
-a leading
-.Ql \&*LOCKED\&*
-on FreeBSD and a leading
-.Ql \&!
-on most Linuxes).
-If there is a requirement to disable password authentication
-for the account while allowing still public-key, then the passwd field
-should be set to something other than these values (eg
-.Ql NP
-or
-.Ql \&*NP\&*
-).
-.Pp
-If the client successfully authenticates itself, a dialog for
-preparing the session is entered.
-At this time the client may request
-things like allocating a pseudo-tty, forwarding X11 connections,
-forwarding TCP connections, or forwarding the authentication agent
-connection over the secure channel.
-.Pp
-After this, the client either requests a shell or execution of a command.
-The sides then enter session mode.
-In this mode, either side may send
-data at any time, and such data is forwarded to/from the shell or
-command on the server side, and the user terminal in the client side.
-.Pp
-When the user program terminates and all forwarded X11 and other
-connections have been closed, the server sends command exit status to
-the client, and both sides exit.
-.Sh LOGIN PROCESS
-When a user successfully logs in,
-.Nm
-does the following:
-.Bl -enum -offset indent
-.It
-If the login is on a tty, and no command has been specified,
-prints last login time and
-.Pa /etc/motd
-(unless prevented in the configuration file or by
-.Pa ~/.hushlogin ;
-see the
-.Sx FILES
-section).
-.It
-If the login is on a tty, records login time.
-.It
-Checks
-.Pa /etc/nologin ;
-if it exists, prints contents and quits
-(unless root).
-.It
-Changes to run with normal user privileges.
-.It
-Sets up basic environment.
-.It
-Reads the file
-.Pa ~/.ssh/environment ,
-if it exists, and users are allowed to change their environment.
-See the
-.Cm PermitUserEnvironment
-option in
-.Xr sshd_config 5 .
-.It
-Changes to user's home directory.
-.It
-If
-.Pa ~/.ssh/rc
-exists and the
-.Xr sshd_config 5
-.Cm PermitUserRC
-option is set, runs it; else if
-.Pa /etc/ssh/sshrc
-exists, runs
-it; otherwise runs xauth.
-The
-.Dq rc
-files are given the X11
-authentication protocol and cookie in standard input.
-See
-.Sx SSHRC ,
-below.
-.It
-Runs user's shell or command.
-All commands are run under the user's login shell as specified in the
-system password database.
-.El
-.Sh SSHRC
-If the file
-.Pa ~/.ssh/rc
-exists,
-.Xr sh 1
-runs it after reading the
-environment files but before starting the user's shell or command.
-It must not produce any output on stdout; stderr must be used
-instead.
-If X11 forwarding is in use, it will receive the "proto cookie" pair in
-its standard input (and
-.Ev DISPLAY
-in its environment).
-The script must call
-.Xr xauth 1
-because
-.Nm
-will not run xauth automatically to add X11 cookies.
-.Pp
-The primary purpose of this file is to run any initialization routines
-which may be needed before the user's home directory becomes
-accessible; AFS is a particular example of such an environment.
-.Pp
-This file will probably contain some initialization code followed by
-something similar to:
-.Bd -literal -offset 3n
-if read proto cookie && [ -n "$DISPLAY" ]; then
-	if [ `echo $DISPLAY | cut -c1-10` = 'localhost:' ]; then
-		# X11UseLocalhost=yes
-		echo add unix:`echo $DISPLAY |
-		    cut -c11-` $proto $cookie
-	else
-		# X11UseLocalhost=no
-		echo add $DISPLAY $proto $cookie
-	fi | xauth -q -
-fi
-.Ed

-If this file does not exist,
-.Pa /etc/ssh/sshrc
-is run, and if that
-does not exist either, xauth is used to add the cookie.
-.Sh AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE FORMAT
-.Cm AuthorizedKeysFile
-specifies the files containing public keys for
-public key authentication;
-if this option is not specified, the default is
-.Pa ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
-and
-.Pa ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 .
-Each line of the file contains one
-key (empty lines and lines starting with a
-.Ql #
-are ignored as
-comments).
-Public keys consist of the following space-separated fields:
-options, keytype, base64-encoded key, comment.
-The options field is optional.
-The keytype is
-.Dq ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 ,
-.Dq ecdsa-sha2-nistp384 ,
-.Dq ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 ,
-.Dq ssh-ed25519 ,
-.Dq ssh-dss
-or
-.Dq ssh-rsa ;
-the comment field is not used for anything (but may be convenient for the
-user to identify the key).
-.Pp
-Note that lines in this file can be several hundred bytes long
-(because of the size of the public key encoding) up to a limit of
-8 kilobytes, which permits DSA keys up to 8 kilobits and RSA
-keys up to 16 kilobits.
-You don't want to type them in; instead, copy the
-.Pa id_dsa.pub ,
-.Pa id_ecdsa.pub ,
-.Pa id_ed25519.pub ,
-or the
-.Pa id_rsa.pub
-file and edit it.
-.Pp
-.Nm
-enforces a minimum RSA key modulus size of 768 bits.
-.Pp
-The options (if present) consist of comma-separated option
-specifications.
-No spaces are permitted, except within double quotes.
-The following option specifications are supported (note
-that option keywords are case-insensitive):
-.Bl -tag -width Ds
-.It Cm agent-forwarding
-Enable authentication agent forwarding previously disabled by the
-.Cm restrict
-option.
-.It Cm cert-authority
-Specifies that the listed key is a certification authority (CA) that is
-trusted to validate signed certificates for user authentication.
-.Pp
-Certificates may encode access restrictions similar to these key options.
-If both certificate restrictions and key options are present, the most
-restrictive union of the two is applied.
-.It Cm command="command"
-Specifies that the command is executed whenever this key is used for
-authentication.
-The command supplied by the user (if any) is ignored.
-The command is run on a pty if the client requests a pty;
-otherwise it is run without a tty.
-If an 8-bit clean channel is required,
-one must not request a pty or should specify
-.Cm no-pty .
-A quote may be included in the command by quoting it with a backslash.
-.Pp
-This option might be useful
-to restrict certain public keys to perform just a specific operation.
-An example might be a key that permits remote backups but nothing else.
-Note that the client may specify TCP and/or X11
-forwarding unless they are explicitly prohibited, e.g. using the
-.Cm restrict
-key option.
-.Pp
-The command originally supplied by the client is available in the
-.Ev SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND
-environment variable.
-Note that this option applies to shell, command or subsystem execution.
-Also note that this command may be superseded by a
-.Xr sshd_config 5
-.Cm ForceCommand
-directive.
-.Pp
-If a command is specified and a forced-command is embedded in a certificate
-used for authentication, then the certificate will be accepted only if the
-two commands are identical.
-.It Cm environment="NAME=value"
-Specifies that the string is to be added to the environment when
-logging in using this key.
-Environment variables set this way
-override other default environment values.
-Multiple options of this type are permitted.
-Environment processing is disabled by default and is
-controlled via the
-.Cm PermitUserEnvironment
-option.
-.It Cm from="pattern-list"
-Specifies that in addition to public key authentication, either the canonical
-name of the remote host or its IP address must be present in the
-comma-separated list of patterns.
-See PATTERNS in
-.Xr ssh_config 5
-for more information on patterns.
-.Pp
-In addition to the wildcard matching that may be applied to hostnames or
-addresses, a
-.Cm from
-stanza may match IP addresses using CIDR address/masklen notation.
-.Pp
-The purpose of this option is to optionally increase security: public key
-authentication by itself does not trust the network or name servers or
-anything (but the key); however, if somebody somehow steals the key, the key
-permits an intruder to log in from anywhere in the world.
-This additional option makes using a stolen key more difficult (name
-servers and/or routers would have to be compromised in addition to
-just the key).
-.It Cm no-agent-forwarding
-Forbids authentication agent forwarding when this key is used for
-authentication.
-.It Cm no-port-forwarding
-Forbids TCP forwarding when this key is used for authentication.
-Any port forward requests by the client will return an error.
-This might be used, e.g. in connection with the
-.Cm command
-option.
-.It Cm no-pty
-Prevents tty allocation (a request to allocate a pty will fail).
-.It Cm no-user-rc
-Disables execution of
-.Pa ~/.ssh/rc .
-.It Cm no-X11-forwarding
-Forbids X11 forwarding when this key is used for authentication.
-Any X11 forward requests by the client will return an error.
-.It Cm permitopen="host:port"
-Limit local port forwarding with
-.Xr ssh 1
-.Fl L
-such that it may only connect to the specified host and port.
-IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in square brackets.
-Multiple
-.Cm permitopen
-options may be applied separated by commas.
-No pattern matching is performed on the specified hostnames,
-they must be literal domains or addresses.
-A port specification of
-.Cm *
-matches any port.
-.It Cm port-forwarding
-Enable port forwarding previously disabled by the
-.Cm restrict
-.It Cm principals="principals"
-On a
-.Cm cert-authority
-line, specifies allowed principals for certificate authentication as a
-comma-separated list.
-At least one name from the list must appear in the certificate's
-list of principals for the certificate to be accepted.
-This option is ignored for keys that are not marked as trusted certificate
-signers using the
-.Cm cert-authority
-option.
-.It Cm pty
-Permits tty allocation previously disabled by the
-.Cm restrict
-option.
-.It Cm restrict
-Enable all restrictions, i.e. disable port, agent and X11 forwarding,
-as well as disabling PTY allocation
-and execution of
-.Pa ~/.ssh/rc .
-If any future restriction capabilities are added to authorized_keys files
-they will be included in this set.
-.It Cm tunnel="n"
-Force a
-.Xr tun 4
-device on the server.
-Without this option, the next available device will be used if
-the client requests a tunnel.
-.It Cm user-rc
-Enables execution of
-.Pa ~/.ssh/rc
-previously disabled by the
-.Cm restrict
-option.
-.It Cm X11-forwarding
-Permits X11 forwarding previously disabled by the
-.Cm restrict
-option.

-.Sh SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS FILE FORMAT
-The
-.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts
-and
-.Pa ~/.ssh/known_hosts
-files contain host public keys for all known hosts.
-The global file should
-be prepared by the administrator (optional), and the per-user file is
-maintained automatically: whenever the user connects from an unknown host,
-its key is added to the per-user file.
-.Pp
-Each line in these files contains the following fields: markers (optional),
-hostnames, keytype, base64-encoded key, comment.
-The fields are separated by spaces.
-.Pp
-The marker is optional, but if it is present then it must be one of
-.Dq @cert-authority ,
-to indicate that the line contains a certification authority (CA) key,
-or
-.Dq @revoked ,
-to indicate that the key contained on the line is revoked and must not ever
-be accepted.
-Only one marker should be used on a key line.
-.Pp
-Hostnames is a comma-separated list of patterns
-.Pf ( Ql *
-and
-.Ql \&?
-act as
-wildcards); each pattern in turn is matched against the canonical host
-name (when authenticating a client) or against the user-supplied
-name (when authenticating a server).
-A pattern may also be preceded by
-.Ql \&!
-to indicate negation: if the host name matches a negated
-pattern, it is not accepted (by that line) even if it matched another
-pattern on the line.
-A hostname or address may optionally be enclosed within
-.Ql \&[
-and
-.Ql \&]
-brackets then followed by
-.Ql \&:
-and a non-standard port number.
-.Pp
-Alternately, hostnames may be stored in a hashed form which hides host names
-and addresses should the file's contents be disclosed.
-Hashed hostnames start with a
-.Ql |
-character.
-Only one hashed hostname may appear on a single line and none of the above
-negation or wildcard operators may be applied.
-.Pp
-The keytype and base64-encoded key are taken directly from the host key; they
-can be obtained, for example, from
-.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub .
-The optional comment field continues to the end of the line, and is not used.
-.Pp
-Lines starting with
-.Ql #
-and empty lines are ignored as comments.
-.Pp
-When performing host authentication, authentication is accepted if any
-matching line has the proper key; either one that matches exactly or,
-if the server has presented a certificate for authentication, the key
-of the certification authority that signed the certificate.
-For a key to be trusted as a certification authority, it must use the
-.Dq @cert-authority
-marker described above.
-.Pp
-The known hosts file also provides a facility to mark keys as revoked,
-for example when it is known that the associated private key has been
-stolen.
-Revoked keys are specified by including the
-.Dq @revoked
-marker at the beginning of the key line, and are never accepted for
-authentication or as certification authorities, but instead will
-produce a warning from
-.Xr ssh 1
-when they are encountered.
-.Pp
-It is permissible (but not
-recommended) to have several lines or different host keys for the same
-names.
-This will inevitably happen when short forms of host names
-from different domains are put in the file.
-It is possible
-that the files contain conflicting information; authentication is
-accepted if valid information can be found from either file.
-.Pp
-Note that the lines in these files are typically hundreds of characters
-long, and you definitely don't want to type in the host keys by hand.
-Rather, generate them by a script,
-.Xr ssh-keyscan 1
-or by taking, for example,
-.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
-and adding the host names at the front.
-.Xr ssh-keygen 1
-also offers some basic automated editing for
-.Pa ~/.ssh/known_hosts
-including removing hosts matching a host name and converting all host
-names to their hashed representations.
-.Pp
-An example ssh_known_hosts file:
-.Bd -literal -offset 3n

+.Sh NAME
+.Nm sshd_config
+.Nd OpenSSH SSH daemon configuration file
+.Sh SYNOPSIS
+.Nm /etc/ssh/sshd_config
+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+.Xr sshd 1M
+reads configuration data from
+.Pa /etc/ssh/sshd_config
+(or the file specified with
+.Fl f
+on the command line).
+The file contains keyword-argument pairs, one per line.
+Lines starting with
+.Ql #
+and empty lines are interpreted as comments.
+Arguments may optionally be enclosed in double quotes
+.Pq \&"
+in order to represent arguments containing spaces.
+.Pp
+The possible
+keywords and their meanings are as follows (note that
+keywords are case-insensitive and arguments are case-sensitive):
+.Bl -tag -width Ds
+.It Cm AcceptEnv
+Specifies what environment variables sent by the client will be copied into
+the session's
+.Xr environ 7 .
+See
+.Cm SendEnv
+in
+.Xr ssh_config 4
+for how to configure the client.
+The
+.Ev TERM
+environment variable is always sent whenever the client
+requests a pseudo-terminal as it is required by the protocol.
+Variables are specified by name, which may contain the wildcard characters
+.Ql *
+and
+.Ql \&? .
+Multiple environment variables may be separated by whitespace or spread
+across multiple
+.Cm AcceptEnv
+directives.
+Be warned that some environment variables could be used to bypass restricted
+user environments.
+For this reason, care should be taken in the use of this directive.
+The default is not to accept any environment variables.
+.It Cm AddressFamily
+Specifies which address family should be used by
+.Xr sshd 1M .
+Valid arguments are
+.Cm any
+(the default),
+.Cm inet
+(use IPv4 only), or
+.Cm inet6
+(use IPv6 only).
+.It Cm AllowAgentForwarding
+Specifies whether
+.Xr ssh-agent 1
+forwarding is permitted.
+The default is
+.Cm yes .
+Note that disabling agent forwarding does not improve security
+unless users are also denied shell access, as they can always install
+their own forwarders.
+.It Cm AllowGroups
+This keyword can be followed by a list of group name patterns, separated
+by spaces.
+If specified, login is allowed only for users whose primary
+group or supplementary group list matches one of the patterns.
+Only group names are valid; a numerical group ID is not recognized.
+By default, login is allowed for all groups.
+The allow/deny directives are processed in the following order:
+.Cm DenyUsers ,
+.Cm AllowUsers ,
+.Cm DenyGroups ,
+and finally
+.Cm AllowGroups .
+.Pp
+See PATTERNS in
+.Xr ssh_config 4
+for more information on patterns.
+.It Cm AllowStreamLocalForwarding
+Specifies whether StreamLocal (Unix-domain socket) forwarding is permitted.
+The available options are
+.Cm yes
+(the default)
+or
+.Cm all
+to allow StreamLocal forwarding,
+.Cm no
+to prevent all StreamLocal forwarding,
+.Cm local
+to allow local (from the perspective of
+.Xr ssh 1 )
+forwarding only or
+.Cm remote
+to allow remote forwarding only.
+Note that disabling StreamLocal forwarding does not improve security unless
+users are also denied shell access, as they can always install their
+own forwarders.
+.It Cm AllowTcpForwarding
+Specifies whether TCP forwarding is permitted.
+The available options are
+.Cm yes
+(the default)
+or
+.Cm all
+to allow TCP forwarding,
+.Cm no
+to prevent all TCP forwarding,
+.Cm local
+to allow local (from the perspective of
+.Xr ssh 1 )
+forwarding only or
+.Cm remote
+to allow remote forwarding only.
+Note that disabling TCP forwarding does not improve security unless
+users are also denied shell access, as they can always install their
+own forwarders.
+.It Cm AllowUsers
+This keyword can be followed by a list of user name patterns, separated
+by spaces.
+If specified, login is allowed only for user names that
+match one of the patterns.
+Only user names are valid; a numerical user ID is not recognized.
+By default, login is allowed for all users.
+If the pattern takes the form USER@HOST then USER and HOST
+are separately checked, restricting logins to particular
+users from particular hosts.
+HOST criteria may additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR
+address/masklen format.
+The allow/deny directives are processed in the following order:
+.Cm DenyUsers ,
+.Cm AllowUsers ,
+.Cm DenyGroups ,
+and finally
+.Cm AllowGroups .
+.Pp
+See PATTERNS in
+.Xr ssh_config 4
+for more information on patterns.
+.It Cm AuthenticationMethods
+Specifies the authentication methods that must be successfully completed
+for a user to be granted access.
+This option must be followed by one or more comma-separated lists of
+authentication method names, or by the single string
+.Cm any
+to indicate the default behaviour of accepting any single authentication
+method.
+If the default is overridden, then successful authentication requires
+completion of every method in at least one of these lists.
+.Pp
+For example,
+.Qq publickey,password publickey,keyboard-interactive
+would require the user to complete public key authentication, followed by
+either password or keyboard interactive authentication.
+Only methods that are next in one or more lists are offered at each stage,
+so for this example it would not be possible to attempt password or
+keyboard-interactive authentication before public key.
+.Pp
+For keyboard interactive authentication it is also possible to
+restrict authentication to a specific device by appending a
+colon followed by the device identifier
+.Cm bsdauth ,
+.Cm pam ,
+or
+.Cm skey ,
+depending on the server configuration.
+For example,
+.Qq keyboard-interactive:bsdauth
+would restrict keyboard interactive authentication to the
+.Cm bsdauth
+device.
+.Pp
+If the publickey method is listed more than once,
+.Xr sshd 1M
+verifies that keys that have been used successfully are not reused for
+subsequent authentications.
+For example,
+.Qq publickey,publickey
+requires successful authentication using two different public keys.
+.Pp
+Note that each authentication method listed should also be explicitly enabled
+in the configuration.
+.It Cm AuthorizedKeysCommand
+Specifies a program to be used to look up the user's public keys.
+The program must be owned by root, not writable by group or others and
+specified by an absolute path.
+Arguments to
+.Cm AuthorizedKeysCommand
+accept the tokens described in the
+.Sx TOKENS
+section.
+If no arguments are specified then the username of the target user is used.
+.Pp
+The program should produce on standard output zero or
+more lines of authorized_keys output (see
+.Sx AUTHORIZED_KEYS
+in
+.Xr sshd 1M ) .
+If a key supplied by
+.Cm AuthorizedKeysCommand
+does not successfully authenticate
+and authorize the user then public key authentication continues using the usual
+.Cm AuthorizedKeysFile
+files.
+By default, no
+.Cm AuthorizedKeysCommand
+is run.
+.It Cm AuthorizedKeysCommandUser
+Specifies the user under whose account the
+.Cm AuthorizedKeysCommand
+is run.
+It is recommended to use a dedicated user that has no other role on the host
+than running authorized keys commands.
+If
+.Cm AuthorizedKeysCommand
+is specified but
+.Cm AuthorizedKeysCommandUser
+is not, then
+.Xr sshd 1M
+will refuse to start.
+.It Cm AuthorizedKeysFile
+Specifies the file that contains the public keys used for user authentication.
+The format is described in the
+.Sx AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE FORMAT
+section of
+.Xr sshd 1M .
+Arguments to
+.Cm AuthorizedKeysFile
+accept the tokens described in the

+section.
+After expansion,
+.Cm AuthorizedKeysFile
+is taken to be an absolute path or one relative to the user's home
+directory.
+Multiple files may be listed, separated by whitespace.
+Alternately this option may be set to
+.Cm none
+to skip checking for user keys in files.
+The default is
+.Qq .ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys2 .
+.It Cm AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand
+Specifies a program to be used to generate the list of allowed
+certificate principals as per
+.Cm AuthorizedPrincipalsFile .
+The program must be owned by root, not writable by group or others and
+specified by an absolute path.
+Arguments to
+.Cm AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand
+accept the tokens described in the

+section.
+If no arguments are specified then the username of the target user is used.
+.Pp
+The program should produce on standard output zero or
+more lines of
+.Cm AuthorizedPrincipalsFile
+output.
+If either
+.Cm AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand
+or
+.Cm AuthorizedPrincipalsFile
+is specified, then certificates offered by the client for authentication
+must contain a principal that is listed.
+By default, no
+.Cm AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand
+is run.
+.It Cm AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser
+Specifies the user under whose account the
+.Cm AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand
+is run.
+It is recommended to use a dedicated user that has no other role on the host
+than running authorized principals commands.
+If
+.Cm AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand
+is specified but
+.Cm AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser
+is not, then
+.Xr sshd 1M
+will refuse to start.
+.It Cm AuthorizedPrincipalsFile
+Specifies a file that lists principal names that are accepted for
+certificate authentication.
+When using certificates signed by a key listed in
+.Cm TrustedUserCAKeys ,
+this file lists names, one of which must appear in the certificate for it
+to be accepted for authentication.
+Names are listed one per line preceded by key options (as described in

+section.
+After expansion,
+.Cm AuthorizedPrincipalsFile
+is taken to be an absolute path or one relative to the user's home directory.
+The default is
+.Cm none ,
+i.e. not to use a principals file \(en in this case, the username
+of the user must appear in a certificate's principals list for it to be
+accepted.
+.Pp
+Note that
+.Cm AuthorizedPrincipalsFile
+is only used when authentication proceeds using a CA listed in
+.Cm TrustedUserCAKeys
+and is not consulted for certification authorities trusted via
+.Pa ~/.ssh/authorized_keys ,
+though the
+.Cm principals=
+key option offers a similar facility (see
+.Xr sshd 1M
+for details).
+.It Cm Banner
+The contents of the specified file are sent to the remote user before
+authentication is allowed.
+If the argument is
+.Cm none
+then no banner is displayed.
+By default, no banner is displayed.
+.It Cm ChallengeResponseAuthentication
+Specifies whether challenge-response authentication is allowed (e.g. via
+PAM or through authentication styles supported in
+.Xr login.conf 5 )
+The default is
+.Cm yes .
+.It Cm ChrootDirectory
+Specifies the pathname of a directory to
+.Xr chroot 2
+to after authentication.
+At session startup
+.Xr sshd 1M
+checks that all components of the pathname are root-owned directories
+which are not writable by any other user or group.
+After the chroot,
+.Xr sshd 1M
+changes the working directory to the user's home directory.
+Arguments to
+.Cm ChrootDirectory
+accept the tokens described in the
+.Sx TOKENS
+section.
+.Pp
+The
+.Cm ChrootDirectory
+must contain the necessary files and directories to support the
+user's session.
+For an interactive session this requires at least a shell, typically
+.Xr sh 1 ,
+and basic
+.Pa /dev
+nodes such as
+.Xr null 4 ,
+.Xr zero 4 ,
+.Xr stdin 4 ,
+.Xr stdout 4 ,
+.Xr stderr 4 ,
+and
+.Xr tty 4
+devices.
+For file transfer sessions using SFTP
+no additional configuration of the environment is necessary if the in-process
+sftp-server is used,
+though sessions which use logging may require
+.Pa /dev/log
+inside the chroot directory on some operating systems (see
+.Xr sftp-server 1M
+for details).
+.Pp
+For safety, it is very important that the directory hierarchy be
+prevented from modification by other processes on the system (especially
+those outside the jail).
+Misconfiguration can lead to unsafe environments which
+.Xr sshd 1M
+cannot detect.
+.Pp
+The default is
+.Cm none ,
+indicating not to
+.Xr chroot 2 .
+.It Cm Ciphers
+Specifies the ciphers allowed.
+Multiple ciphers must be comma-separated.
+If the specified value begins with a

+.Qq ssh -Q cipher .
+.It Cm ClientAliveCountMax
+Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without
+.Xr sshd 1M
+receiving any messages back from the client.
+If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent,
+sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session.
+It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very
+different from
+.Cm TCPKeepAlive .
+The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel
+and therefore will not be spoofable.
+The TCP keepalive option enabled by
+.Cm TCPKeepAlive
+is spoofable.
+The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or
+server depend on knowing when a connection has become inactive.
+.Pp
+The default value is 3.
+If
+.Cm ClientAliveInterval
+is set to 15, and
+.Cm ClientAliveCountMax
+is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients
+will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds.
+.It Cm ClientAliveInterval
+Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received
+from the client,
+.Xr sshd 1M
+will send a message through the encrypted
+channel to request a response from the client.
+The default
+is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client.
+.It Cm Compression
+Specifies whether compression is enabled after
+the user has authenticated successfully.
+The argument must be
+.Cm yes ,
+.Cm delayed
+(a legacy synonym for
+.Cm yes )
+or
+.Cm no .
+The default is
+.Cm yes .
+.It Cm DenyGroups
+This keyword can be followed by a list of group name patterns, separated
+by spaces.
+Login is disallowed for users whose primary group or supplementary
+group list matches one of the patterns.
+Only group names are valid; a numerical group ID is not recognized.
+By default, login is allowed for all groups.
+The allow/deny directives are processed in the following order:
+.Cm DenyUsers ,
+.Cm AllowUsers ,
+.Cm DenyGroups ,
+and finally
+.Cm AllowGroups .
+.Pp
+See PATTERNS in
+.Xr ssh_config 4
+for more information on patterns.
+.It Cm DenyUsers
+This keyword can be followed by a list of user name patterns, separated
+by spaces.
+Login is disallowed for user names that match one of the patterns.
+Only user names are valid; a numerical user ID is not recognized.
+By default, login is allowed for all users.
+If the pattern takes the form USER@HOST then USER and HOST
+are separately checked, restricting logins to particular
+users from particular hosts.
+HOST criteria may additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR
+address/masklen format.
+The allow/deny directives are processed in the following order:
+.Cm DenyUsers ,
+.Cm AllowUsers ,
+.Cm DenyGroups ,
+and finally
+.Cm AllowGroups .
+.Pp
+See PATTERNS in
+.Xr ssh_config 4
+for more information on patterns.
+.It Cm DisableForwarding
+Disables all forwarding features, including X11,
+.Xr ssh-agent 1 ,
+TCP and StreamLocal.
+This option overrides all other forwarding-related options and may
+simplify restricted configurations.
+.It Cm FingerprintHash
+Specifies the hash algorithm used when logging key fingerprints.
+Valid options are:
+.Cm md5
+and
+.Cm sha256 .
+The default is
+.Cm sha256 .
+.It Cm ForceCommand
+Forces the execution of the command specified by
+.Cm ForceCommand ,
+ignoring any command supplied by the client and
+.Pa ~/.ssh/rc
+if present.
+The command is invoked by using the user's login shell with the -c option.
+This applies to shell, command, or subsystem execution.
+It is most useful inside a
+.Cm Match
+block.
+The command originally supplied by the client is available in the
+.Ev SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND
+environment variable.
+Specifying a command of
+.Cm internal-sftp
+will force the use of an in-process SFTP server that requires no support
+files when used with
+.Cm ChrootDirectory .
+The default is
+.Cm none .
+.It Cm GatewayPorts
+Specifies whether remote hosts are allowed to connect to ports
+forwarded for the client.
+By default,
+.Xr sshd 1M
+binds remote port forwardings to the loopback address.
+This prevents other remote hosts from connecting to forwarded ports.
+.Cm GatewayPorts
+can be used to specify that sshd
+should allow remote port forwardings to bind to non-loopback addresses, thus
+allowing other hosts to connect.
+The argument may be
+.Cm no
+to force remote port forwardings to be available to the local host only,
+.Cm yes
+to force remote port forwardings to bind to the wildcard address, or
+.Cm clientspecified
+to allow the client to select the address to which the forwarding is bound.
+The default is
+.Cm no .
+.It Cm GSSAPIAuthentication
+Specifies whether user authentication based on GSSAPI is allowed.
+The default is
+.Cm no .
+.It Cm GSSAPICleanupCredentials
+Specifies whether to automatically destroy the user's credentials cache
+on logout.
+The default is
+.Cm yes .
+.It Cm GSSAPIStrictAcceptorCheck
+Determines whether to be strict about the identity of the GSSAPI acceptor
+a client authenticates against.
+If set to
+.Cm yes
+then the client must authenticate against the host
+service on the current hostname.
+If set to
+.Cm no
+then the client may authenticate against any service key stored in the
+machine's default store.
+This facility is provided to assist with operation on multi homed machines.
+The default is
+.Cm yes .
+.It Cm HostbasedAcceptedKeyTypes
+Specifies the key types that will be accepted for hostbased authentication
+as a comma-separated pattern list.
+Alternately if the specified value begins with a
+.Sq +
+character, then the specified key types will be appended to the default set
+instead of replacing them.
+The default for this option is:

+Specifies whether or not the server will attempt to perform a reverse
+name lookup when matching the name in the
+.Pa ~/.shosts ,
+.Pa ~/.rhosts ,
+and
+.Pa /etc/hosts.equiv
+files during
+.Cm HostbasedAuthentication .
+A setting of
+.Cm yes
+means that
+.Xr sshd 1M
+uses the name supplied by the client rather than
+attempting to resolve the name from the TCP connection itself.
+The default is
+.Cm no .
+.It Cm HostCertificate
+Specifies a file containing a public host certificate.
+The certificate's public key must match a private host key already specified
+by
+.Cm HostKey .
+The default behaviour of
+.Xr sshd 1M
+is not to load any certificates.
+.It Cm HostKey
+Specifies a file containing a private host key
+used by SSH.
+The defaults are
+.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key ,
+.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key ,
+.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
+and
+.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key .
+.Pp
+Note that
+.Xr sshd 1M
+will refuse to use a file if it is group/world-accessible
+and that the
+.Cm HostKeyAlgorithms
+option restricts which of the keys are actually used by
+.Xr sshd 1M .
+.Pp
+It is possible to have multiple host key files.
+It is also possible to specify public host key files instead.
+In this case operations on the private key will be delegated
+to an
+.Xr ssh-agent 1 .
+.It Cm HostKeyAgent
+Identifies the UNIX-domain socket used to communicate
+with an agent that has access to the private host keys.
+If the string

+Specifies the maximum number of open shell, login or subsystem (e.g. sftp)
+sessions permitted per network connection.
+Multiple sessions may be established by clients that support connection
+multiplexing.
+Setting
+.Cm MaxSessions
+to 1 will effectively disable session multiplexing, whereas setting it to 0
+will prevent all shell, login and subsystem sessions while still permitting
+forwarding.
+The default is 10.
+.It Cm MaxStartups
+Specifies the maximum number of concurrent unauthenticated connections to the
+SSH daemon.
+Additional connections will be dropped until authentication succeeds or the
+.Cm LoginGraceTime
+expires for a connection.
+The default is 10:30:100.
+.Pp
+Alternatively, random early drop can be enabled by specifying
+the three colon separated values
+start:rate:full (e.g. "10:30:60").
+.Xr sshd 1M
+will refuse connection attempts with a probability of rate/100 (30%)
+if there are currently start (10) unauthenticated connections.
+The probability increases linearly and all connection attempts
+are refused if the number of unauthenticated connections reaches full (60).
+.It Cm PasswordAuthentication
+Specifies whether password authentication is allowed.
+The default is
+.Cm yes .
+.It Cm PermitEmptyPasswords
+When password authentication is allowed, it specifies whether the
+server allows login to accounts with empty password strings.
+The default is
+.Cm no .
+.It Cm PermitOpen
+Specifies the destinations to which TCP port forwarding is permitted.
+The forwarding specification must be one of the following forms:
+.Pp
+.Bl -item -offset indent -compact
+.It
+.Cm PermitOpen
+.Sm off
+.Ar host : port
+.Sm on
+.It
+.Cm PermitOpen
+.Sm off
+.Ar IPv4_addr : port
+.Sm on
+.It
+.Cm PermitOpen
+.Sm off
+.Ar \&[ IPv6_addr \&] : port
+.Sm on
+.El
+.Pp
+Multiple forwards may be specified by separating them with whitespace.
+An argument of
+.Cm any
+can be used to remove all restrictions and permit any forwarding requests.
+An argument of
+.Cm none
+can be used to prohibit all forwarding requests.
+The wildcard
+.Sq *
+can be used for host or port to allow all hosts or ports, respectively.
+By default all port forwarding requests are permitted.
+.It Cm PermitRootLogin
+Specifies whether root can log in using
+.Xr ssh 1 .
+The argument must be
+.Cm yes ,
+.Cm prohibit-password ,
+.Cm without-password ,
+.Cm forced-commands-only ,
+or
+.Cm no .
+The default is
+.Cm prohibit-password .
+.Pp
+If this option is set to
+.Cm prohibit-password
+or
+.Cm without-password ,
+password and keyboard-interactive authentication are disabled for root.
+.Pp
+If this option is set to
+.Cm forced-commands-only ,
+root login with public key authentication will be allowed,
+but only if the
+.Ar command
+option has been specified
+(which may be useful for taking remote backups even if root login is
+normally not allowed).
+All other authentication methods are disabled for root.
+.Pp
+If this option is set to
+.Cm no ,
+root is not allowed to log in.
+.It Cm PermitTTY
+Specifies whether
+.Xr pty 4
+allocation is permitted.
+The default is
+.Cm yes .
+.It Cm PermitTunnel
+Specifies whether
+.Xr tun 4
+device forwarding is allowed.
+The argument must be
+.Cm yes ,
+.Cm point-to-point
+(layer 3),
+.Cm ethernet
+(layer 2), or
+.Cm no .
+Specifying
+.Cm yes
+permits both
+.Cm point-to-point
+and
+.Cm ethernet .
+The default is
+.Cm no .
+.Pp
+Independent of this setting, the permissions of the selected
+.Xr tun 4
+device must allow access to the user.
+.It Cm PermitUserEnvironment
+Specifies whether
+.Pa ~/.ssh/environment
+and
+.Cm environment=
+options in
+.Pa ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
+are processed by
+.Xr sshd 1M .
+The default is
+.Cm no .
+Enabling environment processing may enable users to bypass access
+restrictions in some configurations using mechanisms such as
+.Ev LD_PRELOAD .
+.It Cm PermitUserRC
+Specifies whether any
+.Pa ~/.ssh/rc
+file is executed.
+The default is
+.Cm yes .
+.It Cm PidFile
+Specifies the file that contains the process ID of the
+SSH daemon, or
+.Cm none
+to not write one.
+The default is
+.Pa /var/run/sshd.pid .
+.It Cm Port
+Specifies the port number that
+.Xr sshd 1M
+listens on.
+The default is 22.
+Multiple options of this type are permitted.
+See also
+.Cm ListenAddress .
+.It Cm PrintLastLog
+Specifies whether
+.Xr sshd 1M
+should print the date and time of the last user login when a user logs
+in interactively.
+On Solaris this option is always ignored since pam_unix_session(5)
+reports the last login time.
+.It Cm PrintMotd
+Specifies whether
+.Xr sshd 1M
+should print
+.Pa /etc/motd
+when a user logs in interactively.
+(On some systems it is also printed by the shell,
+.Pa /etc/profile ,
+or equivalent.)
+The default is
+.Cm yes .
+.It Cm PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes
+Specifies the key types that will be accepted for public key authentication
+as a comma-separated pattern list.
+Alternately if the specified value begins with a
+.Sq +
+character, then the specified key types will be appended to the default set
+instead of replacing them.
+The default for this option is:
+.Bd -literal -offset 3n
+ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,
+ecdsa-sha2-nistp384-cert-v01@openssh.com,
+ecdsa-sha2-nistp521-cert-v01@openssh.com,
+ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,
+ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com,
+ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,
+ssh-ed25519,ssh-rsa
+.Ed
+.Pp
+The list of available key types may also be obtained using
+.Qq ssh -Q key .
+.It Cm PubkeyAuthentication
+Specifies whether public key authentication is allowed.
+The default is
+.Cm yes .
+.It Cm RekeyLimit
+Specifies the maximum amount of data that may be transmitted before the
+session key is renegotiated, optionally followed a maximum amount of
+time that may pass before the session key is renegotiated.
+The first argument is specified in bytes and may have a suffix of
+.Sq K ,
+.Sq M ,
+or
+.Sq G
+to indicate Kilobytes, Megabytes, or Gigabytes, respectively.
+The default is between
+.Sq 1G
+and
+.Sq 4G ,
+depending on the cipher.
+The optional second value is specified in seconds and may use any of the
+units documented in the
+.Sx TIME FORMATS
+section.
+The default value for
+.Cm RekeyLimit
+is
+.Cm default none ,
+which means that rekeying is performed after the cipher's default amount
+of data has been sent or received and no time based rekeying is done.
+.It Cm RevokedKeys
+Specifies revoked public keys file, or
+.Cm none
+to not use one.
+Keys listed in this file will be refused for public key authentication.
+Note that if this file is not readable, then public key authentication will
+be refused for all users.
+Keys may be specified as a text file, listing one public key per line, or as
+an OpenSSH Key Revocation List (KRL) as generated by
+.Xr ssh-keygen 1 .
+For more information on KRLs, see the KEY REVOCATION LISTS section in
+.Xr ssh-keygen 1 .
+.It Cm StreamLocalBindMask
+Sets the octal file creation mode mask
+.Pq umask
+used when creating a Unix-domain socket file for local or remote
+port forwarding.
+This option is only used for port forwarding to a Unix-domain socket file.
+.Pp
+The default value is 0177, which creates a Unix-domain socket file that is
+readable and writable only by the owner.
+Note that not all operating systems honor the file mode on Unix-domain
+socket files.
+.It Cm StreamLocalBindUnlink
+Specifies whether to remove an existing Unix-domain socket file for local
+or remote port forwarding before creating a new one.
+If the socket file already exists and
+.Cm StreamLocalBindUnlink
+is not enabled,
+.Nm sshd
+will be unable to forward the port to the Unix-domain socket file.
+This option is only used for port forwarding to a Unix-domain socket file.
+.Pp
+The argument must be
+.Cm yes
+or
+.Cm no .
+The default is
+.Cm no .
+.It Cm StrictModes
+Specifies whether
+.Xr sshd 1M
+should check file modes and ownership of the
+user's files and home directory before accepting login.
+This is normally desirable because novices sometimes accidentally leave their
+directory or files world-writable.
+The default is
+.Cm yes .
+Note that this does not apply to
+.Cm ChrootDirectory ,
+whose permissions and ownership are checked unconditionally.
+.It Cm Subsystem
+Configures an external subsystem (e.g. file transfer daemon).
+Arguments should be a subsystem name and a command (with optional arguments)
+to execute upon subsystem request.
+.Pp
+The command
+.Cm sftp-server
+implements the SFTP file transfer subsystem.
+.Pp
+Alternately the name
+.Cm internal-sftp
+implements an in-process SFTP server.
+This may simplify configurations using
+.Cm ChrootDirectory
+to force a different filesystem root on clients.
+.Pp
+By default no subsystems are defined.
+.It Cm SyslogFacility
+Gives the facility code that is used when logging messages from
+.Xr sshd 1M .
+The possible values are: DAEMON, USER, AUTH, LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2,
+LOCAL3, LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7.
+The default is AUTH.
+.It Cm TCPKeepAlive
+Specifies whether the system should send TCP keepalive messages to the
+other side.
+If they are sent, death of the connection or crash of one
+of the machines will be properly noticed.
+However, this means that
+connections will die if the route is down temporarily, and some people
+find it annoying.
+On the other hand, if TCP keepalives are not sent,
+sessions may hang indefinitely on the server, leaving
+.Qq ghost
+users and consuming server resources.
+.Pp
+The default is
+.Cm yes
+(to send TCP keepalive messages), and the server will notice
+if the network goes down or the client host crashes.
+This avoids infinitely hanging sessions.
+.Pp
+To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should be set to
+.Cm no .
+.It Cm TrustedUserCAKeys
+Specifies a file containing public keys of certificate authorities that are
+trusted to sign user certificates for authentication, or
+.Cm none
+to not use one.
+Keys are listed one per line; empty lines and comments starting with
+.Ql #
+are allowed.
+If a certificate is presented for authentication and has its signing CA key
+listed in this file, then it may be used for authentication for any user
+listed in the certificate's principals list.
+Note that certificates that lack a list of principals will not be permitted
+for authentication using
+.Cm TrustedUserCAKeys .
+For more details on certificates, see the CERTIFICATES section in
+.Xr ssh-keygen 1 .
+.It Cm UseDNS
+Specifies whether
+.Xr sshd 1M
+should look up the remote host name, and to check that
+the resolved host name for the remote IP address maps back to the
+very same IP address.
+.Pp
+If this option is set to
+.Cm no
+(the default) then only addresses and not host names may be used in
+.Pa ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
+.Cm from
+and
+.Nm
+.Cm Match
+.Cm Host
+directives.
+.It Cm UsePAM
+Enables the Pluggable Authentication Module interface.
+If set to
+.Cm yes
+this will enable PAM authentication using
+.Cm ChallengeResponseAuthentication
+and
+.Cm PasswordAuthentication
+in addition to PAM account and session module processing for all
+authentication types.
+.Pp
+Because PAM challenge-response authentication usually serves an equivalent
+role to password authentication, you should disable either
+.Cm PasswordAuthentication
+or
+.Cm ChallengeResponseAuthentication.
+.Pp
+If
+.Cm UsePAM
+is enabled, you will not be able to run
+.Xr sshd 1M
+as a non-root user.
+The default is
+.Cm no .
+.It Cm UsePrivilegeSeparation
+Specifies whether
+.Xr sshd 1M
+separates privileges by creating an unprivileged child process
+to deal with incoming network traffic.
+After successful authentication, another process will be created that has
+the privilege of the authenticated user.
+The goal of privilege separation is to prevent privilege
+escalation by containing any corruption within the unprivileged processes.
+The argument must be
+.Cm yes ,
+.Cm no ,
+or
+.Cm sandbox .
+If
+.Cm UsePrivilegeSeparation
+is set to
+.Cm sandbox
+then the pre-authentication unprivileged process is subject to additional
+restrictions.
+The default is
+.Cm sandbox .
+.It Cm VersionAddendum
+Optionally specifies additional text to append to the SSH protocol banner
+sent by the server upon connection.
+The default is
+.Cm none .
+.It Cm X11DisplayOffset
+Specifies the first display number available for
+.Xr sshd 1M Ns 's
+X11 forwarding.
+This prevents sshd from interfering with real X11 servers.
+The default is 10.
+.It Cm X11Forwarding
+Specifies whether X11 forwarding is permitted.
+The argument must be
+.Cm yes
+or
+.Cm no .
+The default is
+.Cm no .
+.Pp
+When X11 forwarding is enabled, there may be additional exposure to
+the server and to client displays if the
+.Xr sshd 1M
+proxy display is configured to listen on the wildcard address (see
+.Cm X11UseLocalhost ) ,
+though this is not the default.
+Additionally, the authentication spoofing and authentication data
+verification and substitution occur on the client side.
+The security risk of using X11 forwarding is that the client's X11
+display server may be exposed to attack when the SSH client requests
+forwarding (see the warnings for
+.Cm ForwardX11
+in
+.Xr ssh_config 4 ) .
+A system administrator may have a stance in which they want to
+protect clients that may expose themselves to attack by unwittingly
+requesting X11 forwarding, which can warrant a
+.Cm no
+setting.
+.Pp
+Note that disabling X11 forwarding does not prevent users from
+forwarding X11 traffic, as users can always install their own forwarders.
+.It Cm X11UseLocalhost
+Specifies whether
+.Xr sshd 1M
+should bind the X11 forwarding server to the loopback address or to
+the wildcard address.
+By default,
+sshd binds the forwarding server to the loopback address and sets the
+hostname part of the
+.Ev DISPLAY
+environment variable to
+.Cm localhost .
+This prevents remote hosts from connecting to the proxy display.
+However, some older X11 clients may not function with this
+configuration.
+.Cm X11UseLocalhost
+may be set to
+.Cm no
+to specify that the forwarding server should be bound to the wildcard
+address.
+The argument must be
+.Cm yes
+or
+.Cm no .
+The default is
+.Cm yes .
+.It Cm XAuthLocation
+Specifies the full pathname of the
+.Xr xauth 1
+program, or
+.Cm none
+to not use one.
+The default is
+.Pa /usr/X11R6/bin/xauth .
+.El
+.Sh TIME FORMATS
+.Xr sshd 1M
+command-line arguments and configuration file options that specify time
+may be expressed using a sequence of the form:
+.Sm off
+.Ar time Op Ar qualifier ,
+.Sm on
+where
+.Ar time
+is a positive integer value and
+.Ar qualifier
+is one of the following:
+.Pp
+.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
+.It Aq Cm none
+seconds
+.It Cm s | Cm S
+seconds
+.It Cm m | Cm M
+minutes
+.It Cm h | Cm H
+hours
+.It Cm d | Cm D
+days
+.It Cm w | Cm W
+weeks
+.El
+.Pp
+Each member of the sequence is added together to calculate
+the total time value.
+.Pp
+Time format examples:
+.Pp
+.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
+.It 600
+600 seconds (10 minutes)
+.It 10m
+10 minutes
+.It 1h30m
+1 hour 30 minutes (90 minutes)
+.El
+.Sh TOKENS
+Arguments to some keywords can make use of tokens,
+which are expanded at runtime:
+.Pp
+.Bl -tag -width XXXX -offset indent -compact
+.It %%
+A literal
+.Sq % .
+.It %F
+The fingerprint of the CA key.
+.It %f
+The fingerprint of the key or certificate.
+.It %h
+The home directory of the user.
+.It %i
+The key ID in the certificate.
+.It %K
+The base64-encoded CA key.
+.It %k
+The base64-encoded key or certificate for authentication.
+.It %s
+The serial number of the certificate.
+.It \&%T
+The type of the CA key.
+.It %t
+The key or certificate type.

-.Dt SSHD_CONFIG 5
-.Os
-.Sh NAME
-.Nm sshd_config
-.Nd OpenSSH SSH daemon configuration file
-.Sh SYNOPSIS
-.Nm /etc/ssh/sshd_config
-.Sh DESCRIPTION
-.Xr sshd 8
-reads configuration data from
-.Pa /etc/ssh/sshd_config
-(or the file specified with
-.Fl f
-on the command line).
-The file contains keyword-argument pairs, one per line.
-Lines starting with
-.Ql #
-and empty lines are interpreted as comments.
-Arguments may optionally be enclosed in double quotes
-.Pq \&"
-in order to represent arguments containing spaces.
-.Pp
-The possible
-keywords and their meanings are as follows (note that
-keywords are case-insensitive and arguments are case-sensitive):
-.Bl -tag -width Ds
-.It Cm AcceptEnv
-Specifies what environment variables sent by the client will be copied into
-the session's
-.Xr environ 7 .
-See
-.Cm SendEnv
-in
-.Xr ssh_config 5
-for how to configure the client.
-The
-.Ev TERM
-environment variable is always sent whenever the client
-requests a pseudo-terminal as it is required by the protocol.
-Variables are specified by name, which may contain the wildcard characters
-.Ql *
-and
-.Ql \&? .
-Multiple environment variables may be separated by whitespace or spread
-across multiple
-.Cm AcceptEnv
-directives.
-Be warned that some environment variables could be used to bypass restricted
-user environments.
-For this reason, care should be taken in the use of this directive.
-The default is not to accept any environment variables.
-.It Cm AddressFamily
-Specifies which address family should be used by
-.Xr sshd 8 .
-Valid arguments are
-.Cm any
-(the default),
-.Cm inet
-(use IPv4 only), or
-.Cm inet6
-(use IPv6 only).
-.It Cm AllowAgentForwarding
-Specifies whether
-.Xr ssh-agent 1
-forwarding is permitted.
-The default is
-.Cm yes .
-Note that disabling agent forwarding does not improve security
-unless users are also denied shell access, as they can always install
-their own forwarders.
-.It Cm AllowGroups
-This keyword can be followed by a list of group name patterns, separated
-by spaces.
-If specified, login is allowed only for users whose primary
-group or supplementary group list matches one of the patterns.
-Only group names are valid; a numerical group ID is not recognized.
-By default, login is allowed for all groups.
-The allow/deny directives are processed in the following order:
-.Cm DenyUsers ,
-.Cm AllowUsers ,
-.Cm DenyGroups ,
-and finally
-.Cm AllowGroups .
-.Pp
-See PATTERNS in
-.Xr ssh_config 5
-for more information on patterns.
-.It Cm AllowStreamLocalForwarding
-Specifies whether StreamLocal (Unix-domain socket) forwarding is permitted.
-The available options are
-.Cm yes
-(the default)
-or
-.Cm all
-to allow StreamLocal forwarding,
-.Cm no
-to prevent all StreamLocal forwarding,
-.Cm local
-to allow local (from the perspective of
-.Xr ssh 1 )
-forwarding only or
-.Cm remote
-to allow remote forwarding only.
-Note that disabling StreamLocal forwarding does not improve security unless
-users are also denied shell access, as they can always install their
-own forwarders.
-.It Cm AllowTcpForwarding
-Specifies whether TCP forwarding is permitted.
-The available options are
-.Cm yes
-(the default)
-or
-.Cm all
-to allow TCP forwarding,
-.Cm no
-to prevent all TCP forwarding,
-.Cm local
-to allow local (from the perspective of
-.Xr ssh 1 )
-forwarding only or
-.Cm remote
-to allow remote forwarding only.
-Note that disabling TCP forwarding does not improve security unless
-users are also denied shell access, as they can always install their
-own forwarders.
-.It Cm AllowUsers
-This keyword can be followed by a list of user name patterns, separated
-by spaces.
-If specified, login is allowed only for user names that
-match one of the patterns.
-Only user names are valid; a numerical user ID is not recognized.
-By default, login is allowed for all users.
-If the pattern takes the form USER@HOST then USER and HOST
-are separately checked, restricting logins to particular
-users from particular hosts.
-HOST criteria may additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR
-address/masklen format.
-The allow/deny directives are processed in the following order:
-.Cm DenyUsers ,
-.Cm AllowUsers ,
-.Cm DenyGroups ,
-and finally
-.Cm AllowGroups .
-.Pp
-See PATTERNS in
-.Xr ssh_config 5
-for more information on patterns.
-.It Cm AuthenticationMethods
-Specifies the authentication methods that must be successfully completed
-for a user to be granted access.
-This option must be followed by one or more comma-separated lists of
-authentication method names, or by the single string
-.Cm any
-to indicate the default behaviour of accepting any single authentication
-method.
-If the default is overridden, then successful authentication requires
-completion of every method in at least one of these lists.
-.Pp
-For example,
-.Qq publickey,password publickey,keyboard-interactive
-would require the user to complete public key authentication, followed by
-either password or keyboard interactive authentication.
-Only methods that are next in one or more lists are offered at each stage,
-so for this example it would not be possible to attempt password or
-keyboard-interactive authentication before public key.
-.Pp
-For keyboard interactive authentication it is also possible to
-restrict authentication to a specific device by appending a
-colon followed by the device identifier
-.Cm bsdauth ,
-.Cm pam ,
-or
-.Cm skey ,
-depending on the server configuration.
-For example,
-.Qq keyboard-interactive:bsdauth
-would restrict keyboard interactive authentication to the
-.Cm bsdauth
-device.
-.Pp
-If the publickey method is listed more than once,
-.Xr sshd 8
-verifies that keys that have been used successfully are not reused for
-subsequent authentications.
-For example,
-.Qq publickey,publickey
-requires successful authentication using two different public keys.
-.Pp
-Note that each authentication method listed should also be explicitly enabled
-in the configuration.
-.It Cm AuthorizedKeysCommand
-Specifies a program to be used to look up the user's public keys.
-The program must be owned by root, not writable by group or others and
-specified by an absolute path.
-Arguments to
-.Cm AuthorizedKeysCommand
-accept the tokens described in the
-.Sx TOKENS
-section.
-If no arguments are specified then the username of the target user is used.
-.Pp
-The program should produce on standard output zero or
-more lines of authorized_keys output (see
-.Sx AUTHORIZED_KEYS
-in
-.Xr sshd 8 ) .
-If a key supplied by
-.Cm AuthorizedKeysCommand
-does not successfully authenticate
-and authorize the user then public key authentication continues using the usual
-.Cm AuthorizedKeysFile
-files.
-By default, no
-.Cm AuthorizedKeysCommand
-is run.
-.It Cm AuthorizedKeysCommandUser
-Specifies the user under whose account the
-.Cm AuthorizedKeysCommand
-is run.
-It is recommended to use a dedicated user that has no other role on the host
-than running authorized keys commands.
-If
-.Cm AuthorizedKeysCommand

-.Cm AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser
-is not, then
-.Xr sshd 8
-will refuse to start.
-.It Cm AuthorizedPrincipalsFile
-Specifies a file that lists principal names that are accepted for
-certificate authentication.
-When using certificates signed by a key listed in
-.Cm TrustedUserCAKeys ,
-this file lists names, one of which must appear in the certificate for it
-to be accepted for authentication.
-Names are listed one per line preceded by key options (as described in

-i.e. not to use a principals file \(en in this case, the username
-of the user must appear in a certificate's principals list for it to be
-accepted.
-.Pp
-Note that
-.Cm AuthorizedPrincipalsFile
-is only used when authentication proceeds using a CA listed in
-.Cm TrustedUserCAKeys
-and is not consulted for certification authorities trusted via
-.Pa ~/.ssh/authorized_keys ,
-though the
-.Cm principals=
-key option offers a similar facility (see
-.Xr sshd 8
-for details).
-.It Cm Banner
-The contents of the specified file are sent to the remote user before
-authentication is allowed.
-If the argument is
-.Cm none
-then no banner is displayed.
-By default, no banner is displayed.
-.It Cm ChallengeResponseAuthentication
-Specifies whether challenge-response authentication is allowed (e.g. via
-PAM or through authentication styles supported in
-.Xr login.conf 5 )
-The default is
-.Cm yes .
-.It Cm ChrootDirectory
-Specifies the pathname of a directory to
-.Xr chroot 2
-to after authentication.
-At session startup
-.Xr sshd 8
-checks that all components of the pathname are root-owned directories
-which are not writable by any other user or group.
-After the chroot,
-.Xr sshd 8
-changes the working directory to the user's home directory.
-Arguments to
-.Cm ChrootDirectory
-accept the tokens described in the
-.Sx TOKENS
-section.
-.Pp
-The
-.Cm ChrootDirectory
-must contain the necessary files and directories to support the
-user's session.
-For an interactive session this requires at least a shell, typically
-.Xr sh 1 ,
-and basic

-nodes such as
-.Xr null 4 ,
-.Xr zero 4 ,
-.Xr stdin 4 ,
-.Xr stdout 4 ,
-.Xr stderr 4 ,
-and
-.Xr tty 4
-devices.
-For file transfer sessions using SFTP
-no additional configuration of the environment is necessary if the in-process
-sftp-server is used,
-though sessions which use logging may require
-.Pa /dev/log
-inside the chroot directory on some operating systems (see
-.Xr sftp-server 8
-for details).
-.Pp
-For safety, it is very important that the directory hierarchy be
-prevented from modification by other processes on the system (especially
-those outside the jail).

-.It Cm ClientAliveCountMax
-Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without
-.Xr sshd 8
-receiving any messages back from the client.
-If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent,
-sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session.
-It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very
-different from
-.Cm TCPKeepAlive .
-The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel
-and therefore will not be spoofable.
-The TCP keepalive option enabled by
-.Cm TCPKeepAlive
-is spoofable.
-The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or
-server depend on knowing when a connection has become inactive.
-.Pp
-The default value is 3.
-If
-.Cm ClientAliveInterval
-is set to 15, and
-.Cm ClientAliveCountMax
-is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients
-will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds.
-.It Cm ClientAliveInterval
-Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received
-from the client,

-This keyword can be followed by a list of user name patterns, separated
-by spaces.
-Login is disallowed for user names that match one of the patterns.
-Only user names are valid; a numerical user ID is not recognized.
-By default, login is allowed for all users.
-If the pattern takes the form USER@HOST then USER and HOST
-are separately checked, restricting logins to particular
-users from particular hosts.
-HOST criteria may additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR
-address/masklen format.
-The allow/deny directives are processed in the following order:
-.Cm DenyUsers ,

-ignoring any command supplied by the client and
-.Pa ~/.ssh/rc
-if present.
-The command is invoked by using the user's login shell with the -c option.
-This applies to shell, command, or subsystem execution.
-It is most useful inside a
-.Cm Match
-block.
-The command originally supplied by the client is available in the
-.Ev SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND
-environment variable.
-Specifying a command of
-.Cm internal-sftp
-will force the use of an in-process SFTP server that requires no support
-files when used with
-.Cm ChrootDirectory .
-The default is
-.Cm none .
-.It Cm GatewayPorts
-Specifies whether remote hosts are allowed to connect to ports
-forwarded for the client.
-By default,
-.Xr sshd 8
-binds remote port forwardings to the loopback address.
-This prevents other remote hosts from connecting to forwarded ports.
-.Cm GatewayPorts
-can be used to specify that sshd
-should allow remote port forwardings to bind to non-loopback addresses, thus
-allowing other hosts to connect.
-The argument may be
-.Cm no
-to force remote port forwardings to be available to the local host only,
-.Cm yes

-If set to
-.Cm no
-then the client may authenticate against any service key stored in the
-machine's default store.
-This facility is provided to assist with operation on multi homed machines.
-The default is
-.Cm yes .
-.It Cm HostbasedAcceptedKeyTypes
-Specifies the key types that will be accepted for hostbased authentication
-as a comma-separated pattern list.
-Alternately if the specified value begins with a
-.Sq +
-character, then the specified key types will be appended to the default set
-instead of replacing them.
-The default for this option is:

-A setting of
-.Cm yes
-means that
-.Xr sshd 8
-uses the name supplied by the client rather than
-attempting to resolve the name from the TCP connection itself.
-The default is
-.Cm no .
-.It Cm HostCertificate
-Specifies a file containing a public host certificate.
-The certificate's public key must match a private host key already specified
-by
-.Cm HostKey .
-The default behaviour of
-.Xr sshd 8
-is not to load any certificates.
-.It Cm HostKey
-Specifies a file containing a private host key
-used by SSH.
-The defaults are
-.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key ,
-.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key ,

-.Sm off
-.Ar \&[ IPv6_addr \&] : port
-.Sm on
-.El
-.Pp
-Multiple forwards may be specified by separating them with whitespace.
-An argument of
-.Cm any
-can be used to remove all restrictions and permit any forwarding requests.
-An argument of
-.Cm none
-can be used to prohibit all forwarding requests.
-The wildcard
-.Sq *
-can be used for host or port to allow all hosts or ports, respectively.
-By default all port forwarding requests are permitted.
-.It Cm PermitRootLogin
-Specifies whether root can log in using
-.Xr ssh 1 .
-The argument must be
-.Cm yes ,
-.Cm prohibit-password ,
-.Cm without-password ,
-.Cm forced-commands-only ,
-or
-.Cm no .
-The default is
-.Cm prohibit-password .
-.Pp
-If this option is set to
-.Cm prohibit-password
-or
-.Cm without-password ,
-password and keyboard-interactive authentication are disabled for root.
-.Pp
-If this option is set to
-.Cm forced-commands-only ,
-root login with public key authentication will be allowed,
-but only if the
-.Ar command
-option has been specified
-(which may be useful for taking remote backups even if root login is
-normally not allowed).
-All other authentication methods are disabled for root.
-.Pp
-If this option is set to
-.Cm no ,
-root is not allowed to log in.
-.It Cm PermitTTY
-Specifies whether
-.Xr pty 4
-allocation is permitted.
-The default is
-.Cm yes .
-.It Cm PermitTunnel
-Specifies whether
-.Xr tun 4
-device forwarding is allowed.
-The argument must be
-.Cm yes ,
-.Cm point-to-point
-(layer 3),
-.Cm ethernet
-(layer 2), or
-.Cm no .
-Specifying
-.Cm yes
-permits both
-.Cm point-to-point
-and
-.Cm ethernet .
-The default is
-.Cm no .
-.Pp
-Independent of this setting, the permissions of the selected
-.Xr tun 4
-device must allow access to the user.
-.It Cm PermitUserEnvironment
-Specifies whether
-.Pa ~/.ssh/environment
-and
-.Cm environment=
-options in
-.Pa ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
-are processed by
-.Xr sshd 8 .
-The default is
-.Cm no .
-Enabling environment processing may enable users to bypass access
-restrictions in some configurations using mechanisms such as
-.Ev LD_PRELOAD .
-.It Cm PermitUserRC
-Specifies whether any
-.Pa ~/.ssh/rc
-file is executed.
-The default is
-.Cm yes .
-.It Cm PidFile
-Specifies the file that contains the process ID of the
-SSH daemon, or
-.Cm none
-to not write one.
-The default is
-.Pa /var/run/sshd.pid .
-.It Cm Port
-Specifies the port number that
-.Xr sshd 8
-listens on.
-The default is 22.
-Multiple options of this type are permitted.
-See also
-.Cm ListenAddress .
-.It Cm PrintLastLog
-Specifies whether
-.Xr sshd 8
-should print the date and time of the last user login when a user logs
-in interactively.
-On Solaris this option is always ignored since pam_unix_session(5)
-reports the last login time.
-.It Cm PrintMotd
-Specifies whether
-.Xr sshd 8
-should print
-.Pa /etc/motd
-when a user logs in interactively.
-(On some systems it is also printed by the shell,
-.Pa /etc/profile ,
-or equivalent.)
-The default is
-.Cm yes .
-.It Cm PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes
-Specifies the key types that will be accepted for public key authentication
-as a comma-separated pattern list.
-Alternately if the specified value begins with a
-.Sq +
-character, then the specified key types will be appended to the default set
-instead of replacing them.
-The default for this option is:
-.Bd -literal -offset 3n
-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,
-ecdsa-sha2-nistp384-cert-v01@openssh.com,

-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,
-ssh-ed25519,ssh-rsa
-.Ed
-.Pp
-The list of available key types may also be obtained using
-.Qq ssh -Q key .
-.It Cm PubkeyAuthentication
-Specifies whether public key authentication is allowed.
-The default is
-.Cm yes .
-.It Cm RekeyLimit
-Specifies the maximum amount of data that may be transmitted before the
-session key is renegotiated, optionally followed a maximum amount of
-time that may pass before the session key is renegotiated.
-The first argument is specified in bytes and may have a suffix of
-.Sq K ,
-.Sq M ,
-or
-.Sq G
-to indicate Kilobytes, Megabytes, or Gigabytes, respectively.
-The default is between
-.Sq 1G
-and
-.Sq 4G ,
-depending on the cipher.
-The optional second value is specified in seconds and may use any of the
-units documented in the
-.Sx TIME FORMATS
-section.
-The default value for
-.Cm RekeyLimit
-is
-.Cm default none ,
-which means that rekeying is performed after the cipher's default amount
-of data has been sent or received and no time based rekeying is done.
-.It Cm RevokedKeys
-Specifies revoked public keys file, or
-.Cm none
-to not use one.
-Keys listed in this file will be refused for public key authentication.
-Note that if this file is not readable, then public key authentication will
-be refused for all users.
-Keys may be specified as a text file, listing one public key per line, or as
-an OpenSSH Key Revocation List (KRL) as generated by
-.Xr ssh-keygen 1 .
-For more information on KRLs, see the KEY REVOCATION LISTS section in
-.Xr ssh-keygen 1 .
-.It Cm StreamLocalBindMask
-Sets the octal file creation mode mask
-.Pq umask
-used when creating a Unix-domain socket file for local or remote
-port forwarding.
-This option is only used for port forwarding to a Unix-domain socket file.
-.Pp
-The default value is 0177, which creates a Unix-domain socket file that is
-readable and writable only by the owner.
-Note that not all operating systems honor the file mode on Unix-domain
-socket files.
-.It Cm StreamLocalBindUnlink
-Specifies whether to remove an existing Unix-domain socket file for local
-or remote port forwarding before creating a new one.
-If the socket file already exists and
-.Cm StreamLocalBindUnlink
-is not enabled,
-.Nm sshd
-will be unable to forward the port to the Unix-domain socket file.
-This option is only used for port forwarding to a Unix-domain socket file.
-.Pp
-The argument must be
-.Cm yes
-or
-.Cm no .
-The default is
-.Cm no .
-.It Cm StrictModes
-Specifies whether
-.Xr sshd 8
-should check file modes and ownership of the
-user's files and home directory before accepting login.
-This is normally desirable because novices sometimes accidentally leave their
-directory or files world-writable.
-The default is
-.Cm yes .
-Note that this does not apply to
-.Cm ChrootDirectory ,
-whose permissions and ownership are checked unconditionally.
-.It Cm Subsystem
-Configures an external subsystem (e.g. file transfer daemon).
-Arguments should be a subsystem name and a command (with optional arguments)
-to execute upon subsystem request.
-.Pp
-The command
-.Cm sftp-server
-implements the SFTP file transfer subsystem.
-.Pp
-Alternately the name
-.Cm internal-sftp
-implements an in-process SFTP server.
-This may simplify configurations using
-.Cm ChrootDirectory
-to force a different filesystem root on clients.
-.Pp
-By default no subsystems are defined.
-.It Cm SyslogFacility
-Gives the facility code that is used when logging messages from
-.Xr sshd 8 .
-The possible values are: DAEMON, USER, AUTH, LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2,
-LOCAL3, LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7.
-The default is AUTH.
-.It Cm TCPKeepAlive
-Specifies whether the system should send TCP keepalive messages to the
-other side.
-If they are sent, death of the connection or crash of one
-of the machines will be properly noticed.
-However, this means that
-connections will die if the route is down temporarily, and some people
-find it annoying.
-On the other hand, if TCP keepalives are not sent,
-sessions may hang indefinitely on the server, leaving
-.Qq ghost
-users and consuming server resources.
-.Pp
-The default is
-.Cm yes
-(to send TCP keepalive messages), and the server will notice
-if the network goes down or the client host crashes.
-This avoids infinitely hanging sessions.
-.Pp
-To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should be set to
-.Cm no .
-.It Cm TrustedUserCAKeys
-Specifies a file containing public keys of certificate authorities that are
-trusted to sign user certificates for authentication, or
-.Cm none
-to not use one.
-Keys are listed one per line; empty lines and comments starting with
-.Ql #
-are allowed.
-If a certificate is presented for authentication and has its signing CA key
-listed in this file, then it may be used for authentication for any user
-listed in the certificate's principals list.
-Note that certificates that lack a list of principals will not be permitted
-for authentication using
-.Cm TrustedUserCAKeys .
-For more details on certificates, see the CERTIFICATES section in
-.Xr ssh-keygen 1 .
-.It Cm UseDNS
-Specifies whether
-.Xr sshd 8
-should look up the remote host name, and to check that
-the resolved host name for the remote IP address maps back to the
-very same IP address.
-.Pp
-If this option is set to
-.Cm no
-(the default) then only addresses and not host names may be used in
-.Pa ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
-.Cm from
-and
-.Nm
-.Cm Match
-.Cm Host
-directives.
-.It Cm UsePAM
-Enables the Pluggable Authentication Module interface.
-If set to
-.Cm yes
-this will enable PAM authentication using
-.Cm ChallengeResponseAuthentication
-and
-.Cm PasswordAuthentication
-in addition to PAM account and session module processing for all
-authentication types.
-.Pp
-Because PAM challenge-response authentication usually serves an equivalent
-role to password authentication, you should disable either
-.Cm PasswordAuthentication
-or
-.Cm ChallengeResponseAuthentication.
-.Pp
-If
-.Cm UsePAM
-is enabled, you will not be able to run
-.Xr sshd 8
-as a non-root user.
-The default is
-.Cm no .
-.It Cm UsePrivilegeSeparation
-Specifies whether
-.Xr sshd 8
-separates privileges by creating an unprivileged child process
-to deal with incoming network traffic.
-After successful authentication, another process will be created that has
-the privilege of the authenticated user.
-The goal of privilege separation is to prevent privilege
-escalation by containing any corruption within the unprivileged processes.
-The argument must be
-.Cm yes ,
-.Cm no ,
-or
-.Cm sandbox .
-If
-.Cm UsePrivilegeSeparation
-is set to
-.Cm sandbox
-then the pre-authentication unprivileged process is subject to additional
-restrictions.
-The default is
-.Cm sandbox .
-.It Cm VersionAddendum
-Optionally specifies additional text to append to the SSH protocol banner
-sent by the server upon connection.
-The default is
-.Cm none .
-.It Cm X11DisplayOffset
-Specifies the first display number available for
-.Xr sshd 8 Ns 's
-X11 forwarding.
-This prevents sshd from interfering with real X11 servers.
-The default is 10.
-.It Cm X11Forwarding
-Specifies whether X11 forwarding is permitted.
-The argument must be
-.Cm yes
-or
-.Cm no .
-The default is
-.Cm no .
-.Pp
-When X11 forwarding is enabled, there may be additional exposure to
-the server and to client displays if the
-.Xr sshd 8
-proxy display is configured to listen on the wildcard address (see
-.Cm X11UseLocalhost ) ,
-though this is not the default.
-Additionally, the authentication spoofing and authentication data
-verification and substitution occur on the client side.
-The security risk of using X11 forwarding is that the client's X11
-display server may be exposed to attack when the SSH client requests
-forwarding (see the warnings for
-.Cm ForwardX11
-in
-.Xr ssh_config 5 ) .
-A system administrator may have a stance in which they want to
-protect clients that may expose themselves to attack by unwittingly
-requesting X11 forwarding, which can warrant a
-.Cm no
-setting.
-.Pp
-Note that disabling X11 forwarding does not prevent users from
-forwarding X11 traffic, as users can always install their own forwarders.
-.It Cm X11UseLocalhost
-Specifies whether
-.Xr sshd 8
-should bind the X11 forwarding server to the loopback address or to
-the wildcard address.
-By default,
-sshd binds the forwarding server to the loopback address and sets the
-hostname part of the
-.Ev DISPLAY
-environment variable to
-.Cm localhost .
-This prevents remote hosts from connecting to the proxy display.
-However, some older X11 clients may not function with this
-configuration.
-.Cm X11UseLocalhost
-may be set to
-.Cm no
-to specify that the forwarding server should be bound to the wildcard
-address.
-The argument must be
-.Cm yes
-or
-.Cm no .
-The default is
-.Cm yes .
-.It Cm XAuthLocation
-Specifies the full pathname of the
-.Xr xauth 1
-program, or
-.Cm none
-to not use one.
-The default is
-.Pa /usr/X11R6/bin/xauth .
-.El
-.Sh TIME FORMATS
-.Xr sshd 8
-command-line arguments and configuration file options that specify time
-may be expressed using a sequence of the form:
-.Sm off
-.Ar time Op Ar qualifier ,
-.Sm on
-where
-.Ar time
-is a positive integer value and
-.Ar qualifier
-is one of the following:
-.Pp
