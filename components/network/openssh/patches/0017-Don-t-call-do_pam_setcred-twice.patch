Subject: [PATCH 17/34] Don't call do_pam_setcred twice

# This issue has been raised with the upstream OpenSSH community:
#
# 2426 OpenSSH doesn't need the second call to do_pam_setcred() on non-Linux
#      platforms
# https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2426
#
# The OpenSSH maintainers added a call to do_pam_setcred() in
# platform_setusercontext_post_groups() with no corresponding bugID along with
# a befuddling comment that initgroups(3C) wipes out supplementary groups:
#
#https://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git/commit/platform.c?id=cc12418e18242ce1f61d7035da4956274ba13a96
#
# This only applies in the Linux world if the LinuxPAM pam_group(8) module
# has been installed and configured which allows one to assign additional
# secondary groups to a user using /etc/security/group.conf in addition to
# /etc/group.  To confuse things a bit more, there is an OpenPAM PAM module
# of the same name, pam_group(8), which has different functionality, it
# performs access control based on group membership.
#
# In short, this additional call to do_pam_setcred() is Linux-specific and
# shouldn't be called on Solaris.
