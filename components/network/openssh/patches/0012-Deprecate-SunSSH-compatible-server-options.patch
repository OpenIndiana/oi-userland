Subject: [PATCH 12/34] Deprecate SunSSH compatible server options

#
# Originally we planned to only deprecate client config (ssh_config) options
# and leave it up to system administrators to remove all SunSSH specific
# server config (sshd_config) options. In internal testing we have discovered,
# that this would bring too much trouble to the said administrators.
# The probability of these options appearing in existing sshd_config files
# is higher than initially though, because some of the options have been in
# default sshd_config file for very long time. Also the consequence of
# unknown server option is harsh - ssh service goes to maintenance mode
# possible rendering the instance not accessible. For this reason we will
# deprecate SunSSH specific sshd_config options too.
#
# This is a Solaris specific change to ease the transition and will not be
# offered upstream.
