#

# Protocol versions supported
#
# The sshd shipped in this release of Solaris has support for major versions
# 1 and 2.  It is recommended due to security weaknesses in the v1 protocol
# that sites run only v2 if possible. Support for v1 is provided to help sites
# with existing ssh v1 clients/servers to transition.
# Support for v1 may not be available in a future release of Solaris.
#
# To enable support for v1 an RSA1 key must be created with ssh-keygen(1).
# RSA and DSA keys for protocol v2 are created by /etc/init.d/sshd if they
# do not already exist, RSA1 keys for protocol v1 are not automatically created.

# Uncomment ONLY ONE of the following Protocol statements.

# Only v2 (recommended)
Protocol 2

# Both v1 and v2 (not recommended)
#Protocol 2,1

# Only v1 (not recommended)
#Protocol 1

# Listen port (the IANA registered port number for ssh is 22)
Port 22

# The default listen address is all interfaces, this may need to be changed
# if you wish to restrict the interfaces sshd listens on for a multi homed host.
# Multiple ListenAddress entries are allowed.

# IPv4 only
#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
# IPv4 & IPv6
ListenAddress ::

# If port forwarding is enabled (default), specify if the server can bind to
# INADDR_ANY.
# This allows the local port forwarding to work when connections are received
# from any remote host.
GatewayPorts no

# X11 tunneling options
X11Forwarding yes
X11DisplayOffset 10
X11UseLocalhost yes

# The maximum number of concurrent unauthenticated connections to sshd.
# start:rate:full see sshd(1) for more information.
# The default is 10 unauthenticated clients.
#MaxStartups 10:30:60

# Banner to be printed before authentication starts.
#Banner /etc/issue

# Should sshd print the /etc/motd file and check for mail.
# On Solaris it is assumed that the login shell will do these (eg /etc/profile).
PrintMotd no

# KeepAlive specifies whether keep alive messages are sent to the client.
# See sshd(1) for detailed description of what this means.
# Note that the client may also be sending keep alive messages to the server.
KeepAlive yes

# Syslog facility and level
SyslogFacility auth
LogLevel info

#
# Authentication configuration
#

# Host private key files
# Must be on a local disk and readable only by the root user (root:sys 600).
# HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
# HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key

# Ensure secure permissions on users .ssh directory.
StrictModes yes

# Length of time in seconds before a client that hasn't completed
# authentication is disconnected.
# Default is 600 seconds. 0 means no time limit.
LoginGraceTime 600

# Maximum number of retries for authentication
MaxAuthTries	6

# Are logins to accounts with empty passwords allowed.
# If PermitEmptyPasswords is no, pass PAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK
# to pam_authenticate(3PAM).
PermitEmptyPasswords no

# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change PasswordAuthentication to no.
# You probably also need to disable ChallengeResponseAuthentication.
PasswordAuthentication yes

# Change to no to disable s/key passwords
#ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes

# Are root logins permitted using sshd.
# Note that sshd uses pam_authenticate(3PAM) so the root (or any other) user
# maybe denied access by a PAM module regardless of this setting.
# Valid options are yes, without-password, no.
PermitRootLogin no

# sftp subsystem
Subsystem	sftp	internal-sftp


# SSH protocol v1 specific options
#
# The following options only apply to the v1 protocol and provide
# some form of backwards compatibility with the very weak security
# of /usr/bin/rsh.  Their use is not recommended and the functionality
# will be removed when support for v1 protocol is removed.

# Should sshd use .rhosts and .shosts for password less authentication.
IgnoreRhosts yes

# Uncomment if you don't trust ~/.ssh/known_hosts
#IgnoreUserKnownHosts yes
