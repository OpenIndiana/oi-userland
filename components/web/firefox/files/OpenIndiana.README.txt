Special Notes for OpenIndiana

Starting with Firefox 123, the User Agent string had the OS changed from SunOS
to Linux.  See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1861847
For those who want the previous behavior, consider installing the extension
User-Agent Switcher and Manager.  Click the extension's icon in the toolbar.
In the line with userAgent, change Linux to SunOS, then cick Apply (container).
For every new release of Firefox, check the userAgent string and make sure the
version number is correct.
