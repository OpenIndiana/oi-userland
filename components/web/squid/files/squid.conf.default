#  TAG: cache_effective_user
#	If you start Squid as root, it will change its effective/real
#	UID/GID to the user specified below.  The default is to change
#	to UID to nobody.  If you define cache_effective_user, but not
#	cache_effective_group, Squid sets the GID to the effective
#	user's default group ID (taken from the password file) and
#	supplementary group list from the from groups membership of
#	cache_effective_user.
#
#Default:
cache_effective_user webservd

#  TAG: cache_effective_group
#	If you want Squid to run with a specific GID regardless of
#	the group memberships of the effective user then set this
#	to the group (or GID) you want Squid to run as. When set
#	all other group privileges of the effective user is ignored
#	and only this GID is effective. If Squid is not started as
#	root the user starting Squid must be member of the specified
#	group.
#
#Default:
# none
