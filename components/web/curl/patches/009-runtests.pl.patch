The various curl NTLM tests try to LD_PRELOAD a test library
called .../tests/libtest/.libs/libhostname.so that's been
created as a pre-requisite to running the numerous Perl tests.

This patch adjusts LD_PRELOAD to be LD_PRELOAD_32 or LD_PRELOAD_64
depending upong whether we are running the 32 or 64 bit tests.

As this is Solaris specific, this patch will not be pushed upstream.
