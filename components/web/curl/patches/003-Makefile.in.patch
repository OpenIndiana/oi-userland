Adjusted to include all the libraries needed to successfully link on Solaris.

Note that on S11, the LIBS line will need to be:
LIBS = $(BLANK_AT_MAKETIME) -lsocket -lresolv -lnsl -lgen
as -lsocket and -lnsl have not yet been subsumed into libc.

This patch needs to be sent upstream, but needs to be reworked first.
