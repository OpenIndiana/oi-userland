.SH NAME
tomcat \- Apache Tomcat Version 8 overview
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Apache Tomcat Version 8 (Tomcat) is implementation of
the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages technologies.
.sp
Tomcat can be enabled by authorized user within the service
management facility (SMF), using the following fault management
resource identifier (FMRI):
.sp
.in +2
.nf
svc:/network/http:tomcat8
.fi
.in -2
.sp
Tomcat enabled via SMF is executed for better security with "webserv"
user credentials and with added "net_privaddr" privilege so it can be
configured to listen on privileged TCP ports (e.g. 80). With default
configuration Tomcat listens on TCP port 8080.
.sp
Unauthorized user can start Tomcat with his or her credentials using
ordinary startup scripts and by setting CATALINA_BASE environment
variable to path with his or her conf/, webapp/ and logs/ subdirectories
(see Tomcat directory structure bellow).
.sp
Similarly it's possible to run multiple SMF Tomcat instances by setting
CATALINA_BASE for both start and stop methods for newly created Tomcat
FMRI.

Contains Tomcat documentation in HTML format. The directory has classical
WEBAPP structure and it's symbolically linked as /var/tomcat8/webapps/docs
(the link is part of web/java-servlet/tomcat/tomcat-examples packages).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB/var/tomcat8/conf/\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Contains Tomcat configuration files. A newly-installed Tomcat
contains a default \fBserver.xml\fR file. This is the main configuration file.
For setting Tomcat environment variables it's possible to create here
\fBsetenv.sh\fR file which is sourced during start by catalina.sh.

Tomcat Web Application Directory where are WAR files put for deployment.
.RE

\fB\fB/var/tomcat8/webapps/ROOT/\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Directory with default (ROOT) web application which is served when URL
is requested without further path specifier (http://hostname/). After
Tomcat packages installation this directory is intentionally left empty
with just index.jsp and index.htm files. The HTML file redirects
requester to Tomcat home page which is in ROOT.example/ directory (this
file is part of web/java-servlet/tomcat/tomcat-examples package). The JSP file is default home 
page which is shown when web/java-servlet/tomcat/tomcat-examples (and thus HTML file) is not
installed. This shall allow better deployment of custom ROOT web
application while maintain upgrade ability via packaging system (without
loosing data).

application).
