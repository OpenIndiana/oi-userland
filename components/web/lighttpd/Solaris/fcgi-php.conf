## for PHP don't forget to set cgi.fix_pathinfo = 1 in the php.ini
##
## In order to use PHP with Lighttpd you need to make sure that the
## appropriate PHP packages are installed and that the paths to the 
## php-cgi binary and the php.ini file are correct. To facilite this 
## the variable "php_bin-path" has been provided. Set this variable
## to the correct values for your setup.
##
## To use this file, add an include directive to the lighttpd.conf file, i.e:
## include "conf.d/fcgi-php.conf" (without the '##'))

var.php_bin-path           = "/usr/php/bin/php-cgi"

global {
  server.modules += ("mod_fastcgi")
}

fastcgi.server             = ( ".php" =>
                               ( "localhost" =>
                                 (
                                   "socket" => "/tmp/php-fastcgi.socket",
                                   "bin-path" => php_bin-path
                                 )
                               )
                            )
