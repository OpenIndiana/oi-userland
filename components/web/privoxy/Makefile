# Regression tests exist for privoxy in tools/privoxy-regression-test.pl,
# however these are not applicable to us since they violate the company policy
# of not allowing third-party programs to communicate outside the company.
#
# To test privoxy, follow the instructions in the privoxy quick start guide:
# http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/quickstart.html
# 
# Privoxy is disabled by default, so make sure to enable it if necessary:
# 	# svcs privoxy
#	# svcadm enable privoxy
# You may need to set the forward address in /etc/privoxy/config to the 
# Oracle proxy to access pages in your web browser with privoxy running.
