# for the sound plugins, we only package vm-sound-pulse
# we do not package vm-sound-OSS and vm-sound-Sun
# on my machine, vm-sound-Sun compiles, but it does not work

# the minimal installation consists of the cog-spur-nodisplay package
# which can run "headless" squeak -nodisplay images
# with only minimal installation requirements (only ksh, libc, math)
