# Package Makefile for the "Classic VM" Squeak Smalltalk system
# See http://squeak.org and http://squeakvm.org
#
# squeak uses cmake and a custom configure script (not GNU autoconf)
# in order to build this package, "cmake" must be installed
#
# squeak is built both in 32-bit and 64-bit mode
# the squeak driver script checks the Smalltalk image (using ckformat),
# and depending on whether the image is 32bit or 64bit,
# it launches the squeak virtual machine 32bit or 64bit for the image
#
# for 32-bit : ckformat reports 6505
# 6505: a 32-bit V3 image with closure support and float words stored 
# in native platform order
#
# for 64-bit : ckformat reports 68000
# 68000: a 64-bit V3 image with no closure support and 
# no native platform float word order requirement
#
# squeak places its 64-bit shared object files in
# usr/lib/squeak/<version>-<svnversion>_64bit/  with a _64bit suffix
# which is unfortunately not conforming to the usr/lib/amd64 usage
# and it generates a hard error by pkglint "64-bit object in 32-bit path"
# so we deliver a patch and rename files
# in order to put the 64-bit objects in their usual usr/lib/amd64 location

# the version is the same as the VMMaker Smalltalk sources
# it cannot be changed here randomly, it must match the VMMaker version
