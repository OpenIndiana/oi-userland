# Package Makefile for the "Classic VM" Squeak Smalltalk V4 system
# See http://squeak.org and http://squeakvm.org
#
# The squeak4 vm can only run Squeak4 images; it will not work with 
# Squeak5 images; squeak5 uses  different technology called "Cog Spur"
#
# squeak4 uses cmake and a custom configure script (not GNU autoconf)
# in order to build this package, "cmake" must be installed
#

# squeak4 can be built both in 32-bit and 64-bit 
# but generally SqueakV4 images are 32bit
BUILD_BITS=32
