This is originally derived from the pkgsrc-joyent set for openjdk11,
considerably modified. Cut from the jdk15 patches as of jdk15+32.

See also README-zero.txt for note on a project zero variant.

JDK 21 now that jdk20 has been forked off.

Issues known that indicate serious bugs, likely due to not integrating
loom correctly as they date back to that change. Specifically, I
suspect we need to provide a working DefaultPoller implementation
rather than the current stub.
* jshell doesn't work
* illuminate doesn't work

Bit of patch noise

21+24

It appears that jline https://github.com/jline/jline3 has been
imported
See illumos-jline.patch for implementation

21+23

Extensive rework of
src/jdk.jlink/share/classes/jdk/tools/jlink/internal/Platform.java
dropped the existing patch, which no longer applies

Atomic, fetch_and_add has been renamed to fetch_then_add

os_solaris_x86.cpp, print_register_info has been reworked; copy the
linux_x86 changes (the function was the same as linux was before).

Need to add static julong free_memory(); use available_memory() as I
can't see why they would be different.

21+21

OperatingSystemProps has become PlatformProps, and restructured a bit.

21+20

Boot jdk bumped to 20.

21+19

More OperatingSystem changes
src/java.desktop/share/classes/sun/awt/FontConfiguration.java
src/java.desktop/share/classes/sun/awt/OSInfo.java
src/java.desktop/share/classes/sun/font/FontUtilities.java
src/java.desktop/unix/classes/sun/print/PrintServiceLookupProvider.java
src/java.desktop/unix/classes/sun/print/UnixPrintJob.java

Delete the patch for src/java.desktop/share/classes/sun/font/CMap.java,
it's very specific to openwin. Ditto
src/java.desktop/share/classes/sun/font/SunFontManager.java

Copy illumos-port-22.patch from openjdk20 to illumos-port-26.patch
here to ensure INT_MAX is defined.

21+18

More OperatingSystem changes. Fixed patches to:
src/java.security.jgss/share/classes/sun/security/jgss/wrapper/SunNativeProvider.java
src/java.security.jgss/share/classes/sun/security/krb5/Config.java
src/jdk.charsets/share/classes/sun/nio/cs/ext/JISAutoDetect.java
The JISAutoDetect.java needed an extra fi as there's a whole extra method.

Also fix
src/jdk.sctp/unix/classes/sun/nio/ch/sctp/SctpNet.java
where Solaris was actually the only consumer.
FIXME: the SctpNet fix is a non-portable hack, the code won't work on
any other platform, as I've unconditionally patched it. This ought to
use the OperatingSystem, but that would involve messing around with
src/java.base/share/classes/module-info.java and
src/java.base/share/lib/security/default.policy
which seems excessively fussy and security-dependent

(Looking at our patches, there are many more opportunities to use the
central OperatingSystem machinery.)

Missed the patch from 21+17 for javaThread.cpp; added illumos-port-25.patch

21+17

Remove anything related to libfdlibm, as that's gone entirely

Remove tribblix-flags-ldflags2.patch; the patched solaris behaviour is
now the default.

src/hotspot/share/runtime/javaThread.cpp uses alloca() so needs the header

test/jdk/java/io/File/libGetXSpace.c uses statfs() which ought to be
statvfs() for us, see illumos-port-24.patch

21+16

Triggered by changes in SdpSupport.java, add SunOS support to
src/java.base/share/classes/jdk/internal/util/OperatingSystem.java
src/java.base/share/classes/jdk/internal/util/OperatingSystemProps.java.template
See illumos-port-23.patch

The new OperatingSystem support has also been used in
src/java.base/unix/classes/java/lang/ProcessImpl.java
which needs a completely different patch

And src/java.base/unix/classes/sun/net/PortConfig.java needs fixing.

Cleanup: merge and remove illumos-signal-2.patch and
illumos-signal-3.patch

Cleanup: remove TAR_CREATE_FILE_PARAM TAR_CREATE_EXTRA_PARAM

Cleanup: remove ThreadPriorityVerbose (was Solaris-only)

Cleanup: remove UseDetachedThreads (always true)

21+15

Trivial patch noise. NULL -> nullptr changes still to do.

21+14

Minor patch noise. NULL -> nullptr changes still to do.

CodeCache::mark_all_nmethods_for_deoptimization() changed.

21+13

Trivial patch noise. NULL -> nullptr changes still to do.

Remove the deprecated platform configure option, as we'll run into
trouble if the 32-bit windows deprecation reuses it.

21+12

Reinstate make/data/charsetmapping/stdcs-solaris, removal broke the build

NULL -> nullptr changes still to do.

21+11

Trivial patch noise. NULL -> nullptr changes still to do.

os::numa_has_static_binding() has been removed.

21+10

Trivial patch noise. NULL -> nullptr changes still to do.

21+9

Trivial patch noise. This was also an update where NULL was being
replaced with nullptr on a large scale. The initial build did not make
those changes for the solaris port.

21+7, 21+8

Trivial patch noise

21+6

Remove unused os::get_page_info().
Add a no-op for os::numa_get_group_ids_for_range().

21+5

Minor patch noise.

The JAVA_WARNINGS_ARE_ERRORS note appears to only occur on some build
machines, which is very odd.

21+4

The reorderMap in MFontConfiguration.java now needs to construct
String[] by hand rather than using FontConfiguration.split()

Something odd has changed that's broken my build; I needed to add
JAVA_WARNINGS_ARE_ERRORS=""
to the gmake command. Otherwise -Werror turns all java warnings into
errors and fails the build. The thing is that there's nothing new here.

21+2, 21+3

Trivial patch noise

21+0

Starting fairly clean.

VM_Version::page_size_count() has been removed, but it's only returning
a constant so we can easily handle that.
