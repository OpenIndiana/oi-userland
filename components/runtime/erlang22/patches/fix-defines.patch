This patch removes all #defines for _XOPEN_SOURCE when compiling on
Solaris.  Erlang is not a conformant application, and making it so
(never mind trying to force conformance against two different
revisions of the spec!) just causes problems.  The default compilation
environment on Solaris should contain all the necessary definitions
for erlang to compile.

This patch is suitable for contribution upstream.  It should be
confirmed on at least Solaris 11, and possibly Solaris 10, if that's
still a target by the upstream community.
