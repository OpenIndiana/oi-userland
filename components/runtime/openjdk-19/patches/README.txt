This is originally derived from the pkgsrc-joyent set for openjdk11,
considerably modified. Cut from the jdk15 patches as of jdk15+32.

See also README-zero.txt for patches to build a project zero variant.

19.0.2

Minor patch noise, needed to remove a hunk for
src/java.base/unix/native/libjava/TimeZone_md.c

19.0.1

Trivial patch noise

JDK19 now in rampdown phase 2

19-31, 19-32, 19-33, 19-34, 19-35, 19-36

No changes

19-30

No need to have a Solaris switch to force fork1(), as of S10 that's
the default behaviour.

Removed checkedNatives code, as it breaks in jdk20.

19-29

No changes

19-28

Trivial patch noise.

Build broken by https://www.illumos.org/issues/14418. That did 2
things -  (1) exposed memcntl and meminfo by default, and (2) changed
the signature for memcntl from caddr_t to void so there's a
mismatch. The fix adopted is to modify the internal java signature for
memcntl to the new version, which still allows builds on older
releases as the old definition in sys/mman.h was effectively invisible
there.

19-27

No changes

19-26

Trivial patch noise

Remove some unnecessary patches
Remove legacy Solaris non-standard resolver behaviour
Remove elfedit, it was only used on SPARC
Stop nosing around in .dtprofile

19-25

Trivial patch noise.
Don't use a fixed 32-bit path to dlopen libXrender

Remove some unnecessary patches
src/java.base/unix/native/libjli/java_md.h
 - new comment is good
src/java.desktop/unix/native/common/awt/fontpath.c
 - shouldn't need to check for SunOS 5.8/5.9
Remove HS_DTRACE_WORKAROUND_TAIL_CALL_BUG, the bug it works around
  was fixed in 2008
Remove remaining SUNPRO and related MLIB_NO_LIBSUNMATH checks
src/java.desktop/unix/native/common/awt/X11Color.c
 - the complexity is over 20 years old and no longer relevant
make/autoconf/flags-cflags.m4
 - adding -DTRIMMED is useless
src/java.desktop/unix/native/libawt_xawt/awt/awt_InputMethod.c
 - unnecessary on illumos and current Solaris (and my S10 system too)
use the 64-bit rdtsc variant

19-24

More patch noise. os::dir_is_empty() has been centralized. Little
split in os::print_context() that added os::print_tos_pc().

19-23

Minor patch noise.

19-22

This includes Project Loom aka virtual threads.

New DefaultPollerProvider; create a DevPollPoller stub that throws 
UnsupportedOperationException similar to the way that the AIX
implementation does. This is enough to make the code compile, and
things like jkstat work, but jshell doesn't present a prompt (it was
fine in 19+21). So this will need a working implementation to fix
jshell and Loom.

19-21

Quite a bit of noise; stack management rework.

19-20

Remove os::available() as it's unused
Remove local os::pause() is it's centralized

19-19

SafeFetch handling completely reworked. Remove it from
src/hotspot/os_cpu/solaris_x86/os_solaris_x86.cpp, and copy
the assembler from the linux x86_64 implementation (as we are the same
toolchain and cpu that seems the obvious choice)
Removed illumos-port-13.patch as it's now irrelevant

19-18

Minor patch noise.

19-17

Now needs jdk18 as the boot jdk.

19-16

Minor patch noise.

19-15

FontConfiguration was broken. The build doesn't generate the fontconfig
files in ${JAVA_HOME}/lib; the file
make/modules/java.desktop/gendata/GendataFontConfig.gmk
is rather different, as the fontconfig.properties files have moved from
make/data/fontconfig to src/java.desktop/`platform`/data/fontconfig


19-14

In src/java.base/solaris/classes/sun/nio/fs, needed to catch
UnixException in close() in SolarisAclFileAttributeView.java,
SolarisUserDefinedFileAttributeView.java and SolarisWatchService.java,
using new close(fd, e -> null) rather than just close().

19-13

Minor patch noise.

19-12

ThreadCritical has been merged into Posix. I've simply deleted
the Solaris one. I'm not 100% sure this is correct as the Solaris
implementation uses Solaris threads as opposed to Posix threads, and
has a bunch of caveats around it, but testing hasn't shown any problem
yet.

Removed the INCLUDE_NMT patch for init.cpp

19-11

Needed to restore src/hotspot/share/services/dtraceAttacher.hpp
See illumos-port-17.patch.
This file should have been removed in the original solaris
deprecation along with the corresponding cpp file, but was forgotten
about, and has recently been cleaned up. As we still #include it, we
need to put it back. As we disable DTrace in any case, it would be
cleaner to simply remove all of it.

19-8,19-9,19-10

Minor patch noise.

19-7

Don't patch update_copyright_year.sh, our awk is now nawk anyway
Fair amount of patch noise.

java.lang.ProcessImpl.java has some SunOS-specific code, and there's
other code we rely on that got removed; I've reverted that in
illumos-port-16.patch so we can get the build to complete, but need to
go back and look at it to see if we actually need the
platform-specific wreckage here.

19-6

Minor patch noise.

19-5

The copy_x86 implementation has been centralised, so
copy_solaris_x86.hpp is now essentially empty

19-4

Minor patch noise

19-3

Minor patch noise
FilterSpuriousWakeups removed

19-2
