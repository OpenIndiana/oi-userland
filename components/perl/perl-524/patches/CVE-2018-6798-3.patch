Subject: (perl #132063) we should no longer warn for this code

The first patch for 132063 prevented the buffer read overflow when
dumping the warning but didn't fix the underlying problem.

The next change treats the supplied buffer correctly, preventing the
non-UTF-8 SV from being treated as UTF-8, preventing the warning.

Origin: upstream
Bug: https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=132063
