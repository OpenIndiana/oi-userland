Subject: [PATCH] PATCH: [perl #131598]

The cause of this is that the vFAIL macro uses RExC_parse, and that
variable has just been changed in preparation for code after the vFAIL.
The solution is to not change RExC_parse until after the vFAIL.

This is a case where the macro hides stuff that can bite you.
