 ssh
 Uses a variant of popen(3) to run multiple copies of the ssh(1)
 command.
-.TP
-mrsh
-This module uses the mrsh(1) protocol to execute jobs on remote hosts.
-The mrsh protocol uses a credential based authentication, forgoing
-the need to allocate reserved ports. In other aspects, it acts just
-like rsh. Remote nodes must be running mrshd(8) in order for the mrsh
-module to work.
-.TP
-qsh
-Allows \fBpdsh\fR to execute MPI jobs over QsNet. Qshell propagates
-the current working directory, pdsh environment, and Elan capabilities
-to the remote process. The following environment variable are also
-appended to the environment: RMS_RANK, RMS_NODEID, RMS_PROCID, RMS_NNODES,
-and RMS_NPROCS. Since \fBpdsh\fR needs to run setuid root for qshell
-support, qshell does not directly support propagation of LD_LIBRARY_PATH
-and LD_PREOPEN. Instead the QSHELL_REMOTE_LD_LIBRARY_PATH and 
-QSHELL_REMOTE_LD_PREOPEN environment variables will may be used and will
-be remapped to LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LD_PREOPEN by the qshell daemon if set.
-.TP
-mqsh
-Similar to qshell, but uses the mrsh protocol instead of the rsh protocol.
-.TP
-krb4
-The krb4 module allows users to execute remote commands after 
-authenticating with kerberos. Of course, the remote rshd daemons
-must be kerberized.
-.TP
-xcpu
-The xcpu module uses the xcpu service to execute remote commands.
