# Removes cast128-cbc support.
#
# At this moment this algorithm is not listed in Approved Security
# Technologies: Standards Details at all. Eventually it will be added as
# deprecated.
#
# SunSSH did not support cast128-cbc. In this respect removing cast128-cbc from
# OpenSSH doesn't constitute a regression in functionality from SunSSH.
#
# Interoperability gain provided by cast128-cbc is negligible, because all
# relevant ssh implementations also provide several more common encryption
# algorithms (aes256-ctr, aes128-cbc, ...) on top of cast128-cbc.
#
# Update Aug 29, 2016:
# This used to be implemented by Solaris specific macro WITHOUT_CAST,
# but now upstream OPENSSL_NO_CAST is used instead. This patch now just
# removes cast references from manpages.
#
# This is a Solaris specific patch and it is not likely to be accepted upstream.
