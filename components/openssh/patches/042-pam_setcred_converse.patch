# Allow PAM conversation for pam_setcred for keyboard-interactive auth
#
# Currently OpenSSH runs pam_setcred with 'fake' conversation function
# sshpam_store_conv. If some PAM module actually tries to converse for
# pam_setcred, sshpam_store_conv fails with PAM_CONV_ERR.
#
# This patch moves calling pam_setcred to the end of actual PAM
# authentication, where there still is a real conversation function
# available. If pam_setcred was already called, doesn't call it the
# second time in do_pam_setcred.
#
# Patch origin: in-house
#
# Reported upstream:
# https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2549
