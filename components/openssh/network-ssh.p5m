    value="OpenSSH provides end-to-end encrypted replacement of applications such as telnet, rlogin, and ftp. Unlike these legacy applications, OpenSSH never passes anything (including user name and password) over the wire in unencrypted form. OpenSSH provides the SSH known host mechanism which verifies that the system you connect to is really the one you intended to. OpenSSH provides secure tunneling capabilities and several authentication methods. It also supports forwarding X11 connections and arbitrary TCP ports over the secure channel."
