Build Layout
---

OpenSSL build is run four times. Once for regular dynamic 1.0.0 non-fips, once 
for static 1.0.0 bits to link with standalone wanboot binary, once for 0.9.8
fips-140, and once for 0.9.8 FIPS-140 canister (in the openssl-fips component)
needed to build 0.9.8 FIPS-140 certified libraries. All builds apart from 
static libraries for wanboot are done for 32 and 64 bits. So, in total, OpenSSL
is built seven times.

For more details on OpenSSL for wanboot see openssl-1.0.0-wanboot/README.
See also comments in all three Makefiles for more information.

The non-fips Build.
---

The non-fips build is the main build of OpenSSL and includes the regular
binaries, libraries, man pages, and header files.

Patches
---

08-6193522.patch
Give CA.pl better defaults. See 6193522 for more information.

11-6546806.patch
Make sure the HMAC_CTX_init(3) man page gets delivered. See 6546806 for
more information.

14-manpage_openssl.patch
Force openssl to install man pages into man[1357]openssl instead of man[1357].

15-pkcs11_engine-0.9.8a.patch
Patch which adds the pkcs11 engine. See also the pkcs11-engine/
sub-directory. 

18-compiler_opts.patch
Adds four Solaris specific configurations (both 32bit and 64bit for both sparc
and x86) to Configure which are then explicitly used by the Makefiles.

Care should be taken if modifying this patch as changes to compile-time options
can change the ABI. One example of this is the use of RC4_INT vs RC4_CHAR.

20-remove_rpath.patch
Prevent build binaries having an unnecessary runpath (/lib).

23-noexstack.patch
Build with non-executable stacks and non-executable data (x86).

27-6978791.patch
Modifies Makefile.shared so that libssl is built with -znodelete.

28-enginesdir.patch
Adds a new "enginesdir" option to the Configure script which allows a user to
specify the engines directory.

29-devcrypto_engine.patch
Modifies engines/Makefile so that the devcrypto engine will be built in the
"engines" directory. 

openssl-1.0.0d-aesni-v4.i386-patch
X86-only patch.
Add a built-in engine, aesni, to support X86 AES-NI instructions, along with
files engines/aesni/aesni-x86[_64].pl.
This patch is for OpenSSL 1.0.0d.  For newer OpenSSL versions, a newer patch
may be needed.

openssl-1.0.0d-t4-engine.sparc-patch
SPARC-only patch.
Add a built-in engine, t4, to support SPARC T4 crypto instructions.
along with files in directory engines/t4.

opensslconf.patch
Modifies opensslconf.h so that it is suitable for both 32bit and 64bit installs.
OpenSSL either builds for 32bit or 64bit - it doesn't allow for combined 32bit
and 64bit builds.

The fips Build
---

FIPS-140 certified libraries for Solaris private use. We wait for OpenSSL 1.0.0
to be FIPS-140 certified in which time we can ship only 1.0.0 with S11 and make
it a public interface.

Patches
---

All the patches from 1.0.0 are used in 0.9.8 as well aside from
14-manpage_openssl.patch which is not needed since we do not deliver 0.9.8 man
pages. Additional patches:

01-7009105.patch
Fixing a bug introduces in 0.9.8q and fixed in 0.9.8r.

sparc-01-ccwrap.patch
Workaround so that fingerprinting the canister during runtime and comparing it
with the saved fingerprint works correctly.
