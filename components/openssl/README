Build Layout
---

OpenSSL build is run four times. Once for regular dynamic non-fips, once 
for static bits to link with standalone wanboot binary, once for fips-140,
and once for FIPS-140 canister (in the openssl-fips component)
needed to build FIPS-140 certified libraries. All builds apart from 
static libraries for wanboot are done for 32 and 64 bits. So, in total, OpenSSL
is built seven times. OpenSSL for wanboot is only built on sparc.

See also comments in all the Makefiles for more information.

OpenSSL Version
--------------

The non-fips Build.
---

The non-fips build is the 'default' build of OpenSSL and includes the regular
binaries, libraries, man pages, and header files.


The fips Build
---

We are now shipping FIPS-140 certified OpenSSL with S11.2 and later.
The admin may choose to activate 'openssl-fips' implementation using 'pkg mediator'.

The wanboot Build
----

There are some significant differences when building OpenSSL for wanboot.

Some additional Configuration options are needed:
-DNO_CHMOD		chmod not available in stand-alone environment
-DBOOT			guard for wanboot specific patches
-DOPENSSL_NO_DTLS1	to avoid dtls1_min_mtu() - DTLS not used anyway

List of object files for wanboot-openssl.o
----

At this moment, object files for wanboot-openssl.o need to be listed explicitly.
This is cumbersome and relatively tedious with respect to upgrading to higher
version of openssl. 

In future, it would be nice, if this could be performed automatically by the
linker. The required interface for wanboot is already defined in a mapfile and
linker option '-zdiscard-unused=sections,files' is already used to discard
unused code. 
But sadly, at this moment when the linker is given all the object files, it
correctly discards some unused files, but references to undefined symbols from
the discarded files don't get discarded along. Later, these undefined references
cause wanboot linking failure. 

In order to determine which openssl object files are required for wanboot,
first build static standalone openssl bits in Userland. As a site effect,
static libraries libssl.a and libcrypto.a are created in build/sparcv9-wanboot.

    $ cd $USERLAND/components/openssl/openssl-default ; gmake build

Next, collect some information from linking wanboot static libraries in ON.
This can be done by the following hack.

    $ cd $ON/usr/src/psm/stand/boot/sparcv9/sun4
    $ touch wanboot.o
    $ LD_OPTIONS="-Dfiles,symbols,output=ld.dbg \
        -L$USERLAND/components/openssl/openssl-default/build/sparcv9-wanboot " \
        WAN_OPENSSL=" -lwanboot -lssl -lcrypto" dmake all

The following sort of information ends up in ld.dbg (note that the debugging
output from the link-editor is not considered a 'stable interface' and may
change in the future):

    debug: file=/builds/tkuthan/ul-wanboot-rebuilt/components/openssl/openssl-default/build/sparcv9-wanboot/libcrypto.a(sparcv9cap.o)  [ ET_REL ]
    debug:
    debug: symbol table processing; file=/builds/tkuthan/ul-wanboot-rebuilt/components/openssl/openssl-default/build/sparcv9-wanboot/libcrypto.a(sparcv9cap.o)  [ ET_REL ]
    debug: symbol[1]=sparcv9cap.c
    ....

Now run the following script in Userland:

    #!/bin/bash
 
    # set to workspace paths:
    USERLAND=/builds/tkuthan/ul-wanboot-rebuilt
    ON=/builds/tkuthan/on11u1-wanboot-rti
 
    BUILD=$USERLAND/components/openssl/openssl-default/build/sparcv9-wanboot
    LD_DBG=$ON/usr/src/psm/stand/boot/sparcv9/sun4/ld.dbg
 
    for i in `find $BUILD/crypto $BUILD/ssl -name '*.o'`
    do
            f=`basename $i`
            if grep -q "^debug: file.*\<$f\>" $LD_DBG
            then
                    echo $i | sed "s#$BUILD/##"
            fi
    done

to get the list of required object files.

Additionally, you can format the list for including to Makefile by:
    sort | tr '\n' ' ' | fold -s -w74 | sed -e 's/^/    /' -e 's/$/\\/'

Linking with wanboot
----

When linking with wanboot please pay attention to following pitfalls.

Correct openssl header files need to be included. This is done in
$ON/usr/src/stand/lib/wanboot/Makefile
Make sure CPPFLAGS point to the right directories.

EXTREME CAUTION needs to be employed, if WANBOOT GREW IN SIZE because of the
changes!
Wanboot is a statically linked standalone binary and it is loaded on a fixed
address before execution. This address is defined in 
$ON/usr/src/psm/stand/boot/sparc/common/mapfile:

	LOAD_SEGMENT text {
		FLAGS = READ EXECUTE;
		VADDR = 0x130000;
		ASSIGN_SECTION {
			TYPE = PROGBITS;
			FLAGS = ALLOC !WRITE;
		};
	};

This address (VADDR) NEEDS TO BE GREATER THEN 
    size of wanboot binary + 0x4000

The reason for this is in how wanboot is loaded by OpenBoot Prom:
1) user initiates boot from network - "boot net"
2) obp loads wanboot binary at address 0x4000
3) obp parses ELF header, reads virtual address where to load wanboot to
4) obp mem-copies .text section to this address
5) obp copies .data section behind .text
6) obp starts executing wanboot at entry address

If the given address is too small, obp overwrites part of .data with
instructions from .text in step 4. resulting in .data being corrupted.
Initialized variables get bogus values and failure is inevitable.
This is very hard to troubleshoot.


Testing wanboot with new openssl
----

With every upgrade of OpenSSL, it is necessary to make sure wanboot builds and
works well with the new bits (post lullaby).

Provided you have a freshly built ON workspace, you can link wanboot with new
OpenSSL bits as follows:

    # copy wanboot-openssl.o to ON build machine
    cp wanboot-openssl.o /var/tmp/

    # prepare to rebuild wanboot
    cd $ON
    cd usr/src/psm/stand/boot/sparcv9/sun4

    # hack to force a rebuild
    touch $ON/build.sparc/usr/src/psm/stand/boot/sparcv9/sun4/wanboot.o

    # modify Makefile and assign the WAN_OPENSSL macro to your binary
    # something like
    WAN_OPENSSL    = /var/tmp/wanboot-openssl.o

    # build a wanboot binary
    build -i dmake all

Wanboot should build without warning.

If there is something like this in the output:

    Undefined                       first referenced
     symbol                             in file
    CRYPTO_ccm128_setiv                 /var/tmp/wanboot-openssl.o
    SSL_get_srtp_profiles               /var/tmp/wanboot-openssl.o
    ssl_parse_clienthello_use_srtp_ext  /var/tmp/wanboot-openssl.o
    CRYPTO_gcm128_setiv                 /var/tmp/wanboot-openssl.o
    ...
    cmac_pkey_meth                      /var/tmp/wanboot-openssl.o
    ld: fatal: symbol referencing errors. No output written to wanboot
    *** Error code 1
    dmake: Fatal error: Command failed for target `wanboot'

some additional work has to be done in OpenSSL to either satisfy the function 
references listed in the linker error message, or to remove the calls to these
functions.

Finally, resulting wanboot binary shall be deployed on some install server and
wanbooting from this server shall be tested.
