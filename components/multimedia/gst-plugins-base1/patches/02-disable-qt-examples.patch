Disable a bunch of the Qt5 stuff.  Previous versions (1.16.x, 0.10.x) didn't
include any Qt5 stuff, and the current examples find qmake but build for
the wrong ABI (64 bit when the rest is 32 bit), causing link steps to fail.

If someone wants to add the .32 and .64 specific config to get qmake to
build the right ABI, these could be re-enabled and included.
