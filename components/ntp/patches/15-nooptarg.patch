This bug has been submitted to the NTP community as NTP bug 3406.
http://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3406
The fix in this patch is specific to the build of the bundled version of NTP
for Solaris. It patches the config.h.in file. A proper fix would replicate
the test in the sntp/configure file in the top level configure file. This patch
may be removed when upgrading to a version of NTP that has a fix for bug 3406
included.
