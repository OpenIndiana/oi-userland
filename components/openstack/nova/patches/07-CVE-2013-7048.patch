    Enforce permissions in snapshots temporary dir
    
    Live snapshots creates a temporary directory where libvirt driver
    creates a new image from the instance's disk using blockRebase.
    Currently this directory is created with 777 permissions making this
    directory accessible by all the users in the system.
    
    This patch changes the tempdir permissions so they have the o+x
    flag set, which is what libvirt needs to be able to write in it and
    
    Closes-Bug: #1227027
