# This package requires package pinentry to be installed. To help
# pkgdepend find that relationship without hardwiring an fmri, specify
# a dependency on a file known to always be present in the core package,
# and allow pkgdepend to generate the fmri.
#
# Mediation: the mediated options are by default sorted in the order:
#	priority, version, implementation-order, implementation
# where "implementation" is sorted lexically.
# The goal is to give priority of package pinentry-gtk over package pinentry.
