.SH NAME
logilab-astng \- Python Abstract Syntax Tree New Generation
.SH DESCRIPTION

The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of
python source code for projects such as pychecker, pyreverse, pylint.

.LP
It provides a compatible representation which comes from the `_ast` module.
It rebuilds the tree generated by the builtin _ast module by recursively
walking down the AST and building an extended ast (let's call it astng ;). The
new node classes have additional methods and attributes for different usages.
They include some support for static inference and local name scopes.
Furthermore, astng builds partial trees by inspecting living objects.

.LP
Main modules are:
.LP

* `bases`, `node_classses` and `scoped_nodes` contain the classes for the different type of nodes of the tree.

.LP
* the `manager` contains a high level object to get astng trees from source files and living objects. It maintains a cache of previously constructed tree for quick access
