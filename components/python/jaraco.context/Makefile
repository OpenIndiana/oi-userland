# Following dependency loops were detected (where 'A --> B' means 'A needs B to
# run tests', and 'A ==> B' means 'A needs B for build and/or run'):

# jaraco.context --> pytest-enabler ==> jaraco.context
#
# To break loops we need to allow this project to integrate without testing in
# a case the required projects are not available yet (bootstrap).
