# Note:
#
# To test we need to fulfill following prerequisites:
#	1) the default system postgres version must match the version we built
#	   psycopg2 for,
#	2) the postgresql service must be running,
#	3) the psycopg2_test database with plpgsql extension must exist.
#
# To check 1) and 2) you can run following commands:
#	gmake print-value-PG_VERSION
#	pkg mediator postgres
#	svcs '*postgresql*'
# To create the psycopg2_test database you could run:
#	su - postgres
#	createdb psycopg2_test
#	psql -c 'CREATE EXTENSION plpgsql;' psycopg2_test
#
# Testing will use the default 'postgres' user.
