# The sdist for this project is missing tests so we need to use github tarball.
#
# This was not reported as issue upstream because reporting bugs related to
# tests in sdist or tests in general to projects maintained by asotile is
# dangerous since he could simply block you when you try to report such bugs.
#
# As of 2023-06-11 I cannot report any issue for this project because I'm still
# blocked by asotile after I reported this:
