# Following dependency loops were detected (where 'A --> B' means 'A needs B to
# run tests', and 'A ==> B' means 'A needs B for build and/or run'):
#
# apeye-core --> coincidence ==> whey ==> pyproject-parser ==> shippinglabel ==> apeye ==> apeye-core
#
# To break loops we need to allow this component to integrate without testing in
# a case the required packages are not available yet (bootstrap).
