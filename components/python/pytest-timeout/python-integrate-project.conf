# The test_suppresses_timeout_when_debugger_is_entered test uses spawn_pytest()
# to execute tests.  The spawn_pytest() have no support for passing additional
# pytest options (see also https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/7207) so
# we cannot disable some toxic pytest plugins (black and mypy in this case) as
# we usually do using the "-p no:PLUGIN" option.  To have tests pass we need to
# make sure both pytest-black and pytest-mypy are not installed during testing.
