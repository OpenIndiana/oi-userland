#
# Note:
#
# To test we need to fulfill following prerequisites:
#	1) the default system mysql/mariadb version must match the version we
#	   built mysqlclient for,
#	2) the mariadb service must be running,
#	3) the (default) test database must exist.
#
# To check 1) and 2) you can run following commands:
#	gmake print-value-MYSQL_VERSION
#	pkg mediator mysql
#	svcs '*mariadb*'
