This is a Solaris specific workaround to reduce the risk of damage to IPS
delivered Python packages by 'pip uninstall'

This patch prevents pip from uninstalling anything from the vendor-packages
folder (that should be done via pkg command). Pip can still see all packages
in the vendor-packages folder (for dependency resolving) but cannot remove
them. This prevents pip from uninstalling IPS related packages and thus
breaking the system.

Updating package via pip will result in new being installed (into the
site-packages folder) and old forced to remain, which will give customer
version he needed but still keep version required by the Solaris. Pip will
further consider only the new version in site-packages (because it is earlier
in the path) and Solaris python components will use the vendor-packages one
(they are all patched such that they don't see other packages at all).

All to-be-deleted paths are checked whether they start with the vendor-packages
path. normalize_path is used mainly to correctly resolve symlinks.
