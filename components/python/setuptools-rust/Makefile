# Tests are supposed to run using 'nox -s test' (see .github/workflows/ci.yml
# in the git repo).  That in turn calls pytest with 'setuptools_rust', and
# 'tests' parameters (see noxfile.py).  The 'pytest' test style is currently
# automatically detected so we just add needed parameters as test targets.
