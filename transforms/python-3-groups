# We have various group dependencies between Python modules to express the
# intent "if installing A, also install B if possible".  This is for cases
# where module A uses module B if it is available.  But in some cases, B
# is not Python 3 ready even though A is.  These group dependencies would
# prevent A-34 from being installed because B-34 does not exist.  So drop
# such group dependencies.
