# The old FMRI scheme of library/python-2/... was renamed to
# library/python/... in Solaris 12 build 41 (with a few follow-ups in build
# 44).  To get this to work, a dependency on the old name was added for each
# package.  Some time later, Python 3 came along, which did not need these
# dependencies.  So drop them for the *-3x version of each such package.
