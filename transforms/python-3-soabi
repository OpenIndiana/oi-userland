# Python 2's ABI for .so files is to simply append ".so".  But for Python
# 3, it appends ".cpython-3#[d][m][u].so", where # is the minor version,
# "d" is added if built --with-pydebug (we don't), "m" is added if built
# --with-pymalloc (we do) and "u" is added if built --with-wide-unicode
# (we don't).  See http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3149/ for details.
