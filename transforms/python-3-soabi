# Python 2's ABI for .so files is to simply append ".so".  But for Python
# 3, it appends ".cpython-3#[d][m][u].so", where # is the minor version,
# "d" is added if built --with-pydebug (we don't), "m" is added if built
# --with-pymalloc (we do) and "u" is added if built --with-wide-unicode
# (we don't).  See http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3149/ for details.

# A newer version of python setup tools enables to create ABI3 compliant
# extensions that should support all python3.X versions where X >= 2.
# The compiled shared libraries have ".abi3.so" suffix to indicate the
# usage of the limited API. Currently, only the components that depend on
# library/python/cffi are forced to generate ABI3 compliant extensions.
# See https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0384/ for more information.
