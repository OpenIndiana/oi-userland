# This set of transforms helps us take a package that's parameterized on a
# platform's versions and emit a package that conditionally depends on those
# versioned packages, predicated on the platform version packages being
# present.
#
# For instance, for a package "mako-generic", we want to create a package
# "mako", which brings in "mako-26" if "python-26" is present, and "mako-27" if
# "python-27" is present.
#
# We do this by grabbing just the set actions from "mako-generic", and emitting
# those conditional depend actions.  We require that the parameterized package
# name end in "-###PYV###" (typically by setting a pkgmogrify variable to
# "###PYV###"), which we also remove here.  This works in conjunction with a set
# of rules in make-rules/ips.mk which create and use another transform file
# that actually emit the conditional dependencies.
