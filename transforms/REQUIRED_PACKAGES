# Convert depend action to REQUIRED_PACKAGES line.  In a case the depend action
# contains multiple fmri attributes (usual for require-any dependency type)
# multiple REQUIRED_PACKAGES entries are printed separated by '|'.  The output
# will be post-processed later to convert '|' to newline and to remove leading
# 'pkg:/' and tailing version info from package name.
#
<transform depend fmri=pkg:/.+ -> print %(fmri;sep="|";prefix="REQUIRED_PACKAGES += ") >

# drop all actions
<transform -> drop >
