                Userland Consolidation Packaging Guidelines.

	Each component that integrates into the Userland consolidation must have at
least one package manifest that describes the content to be delivered.  In some
cases components *may* deliver through multiple packages.  Canonical component
package manifests must be placed in the component's build directory.  They also
must be named *.p5m.

    In order to understand what must go in the content of a package manifest,
it's useful to have an understanding of how a canonical manifest is transformed
into a final manifest used for package publication.  Manifest transformation
takes the following basic path:

    canonical manifest
    (.../{component}/{component}.p5m)
            |
            v
    mogrified manifest
    (.../{component}/{build-dir}/manifest-$(MACH)-{component}.mogrified)
            |
            v
    mangled manifest file contents
    (.../{component}/{build-dir}/manifest-$(ARCH)-{component}.mangled)
            |
            v
    dependencies generated
    (.../{component}/{build-dir}/manifest-$(MACH)-{component}.depend)
            |
            v
    dependencies resolved
    (.../{component}/{build-dir}/manifest-$(MACH)-{component}.depend.res)
            |
            v
    manifest validation
    (.../{component}/{build-dir}/.linted-$(MACH))
            |
            v
    publication manifest
    (.../{component}/{build-dir}/manifest-$(MACH)-{component}.published)
            |
            v
    publication


Canonical Manifest
    The canonical manifest contains actions that can't otherwise be generated
    automatically from the data encapsulated in the component Makefile, gate
    transformations, build tree, and packaging tools.  This includes actions
    for license information, some path related attributes, legacy actions, 
    non-discoverable dependencies, users, groups, drivers, and others.

    Actions that are associated with objects that are specific to a single
    architecture should be tagged with a 'variant.arch' attribute specific to
    the architecture that applied to the action.  Ex:
        file path=/usr/lib/$(MACH64)/libx86onlybits.so variant.arch=i386

    Actions for editable files must include an appropriate 'preserve' attribute:
        file path=etc/gnu/a2ps.cfg preserve=true mode=0644

    license actions should be placed in the canonical manifest.

Mogrified Manifest
    The canonical manifest is combined with a set of the transforms
    in $(WS_TOP)/transforms, and a set of macros to more complete
    package manifest using pkgmogrify(1).  The transforms apply default
    attributes to the various actions in the canonical manifest(s).  More
    detail about the attributes can be found in the transform file themselves.
    The macros applied at the time of mogrification are as follows:
        $(MACH)
        $(MACH32)
        $(MACH64)
        $(PUBLISHER)
        $(CONSOLIDATION)
        $(BUILD_VERSION)
        $(SOLARIS_VERSION)
        $(OS_VERSION)
        $(IPS_COMPONENT_VERSION)
        $(COMPONENT_VERSION)
        $(COMPONENT_PROJECT_URL)
        $(COMPONENT_ARCHIVE_URL)

Dependencies Generated
    The mogrified manifest and the prototype install tree are passed through
    pkgdepend(1) to generate a set of dependencies for the package content.
    These dependencies are only those that "pkgdepend generate" can determine
    on its own.  Additional dependencies that cannot be automatically
    determined by pkgdepend(1) should be placed in the canonical manifest.
    Statically defined dependencies should be described in a canonical manifest
    in an unresolved form (ie. the form generated by "pkgdepend generate").
    Ex:
	    depend fmri=__TBD pkg.debug.depend.file=etc/passwd \
		        pkg.debug.reason=usr/bin/vipw type=require

        depend fmri=__TBD pkg.debug.depend.file=sh \
                pkg.debug.depend.path=usr/bin \
                pkg.debug.depend.reason=usr/bin/psmandup \
                pkg.debug.depend.type=script type=require

    This will allow the next step to resolve all dependencies to their proper
    package(s).

Dependencies Resolved
    The manifest with unresolved dependencies is passed through pkgdepend(1)
    again to resolve dependencies against the package repositories.  The result
    is a manifest that is suitable for publication.  All these manifests are
    processed together in a single step, which is more efficient than resolving
    dependencies in each manifest separately.  While each manifest ends up with
    a .depend.res copy in the build directory, the umbrella dependency
    resolution target is {build-dir}/.resolved-$(MACH).

    The resolution step is also set up to use the -e flag to pkgdepend resolve,
    which limits the set of packages it looks at to resolve the dependencies it
    generated in the previous step.  This makes the resolution step a great deal
    faster, but requires that you include a static list of these packages in
    your component Makefile REQUIRED_PACKAGES macro. You can automatically
    add REQURIED_PACKAGES settings for the packages used in dependency
    resolution by running "gmake REQUIRED_PACKAGES". Once you have done so,
    you should manually verify the Makefile additions. Having extra
    packages in there is safe.

    This list is kept as the REQUIRED_PACKAGES list in your component
    Makefile, which you must append to (as shared-rules introduce some
    packages there themselves for your benefit).

    To test, run "gmake clean" and re-publish.

    Note that there is a possibility the list of dependencies will be different
    on different architectures, so you should run this on both sparc and x86,
    and combine the two lists.  Please keep the lists sorted.

Manifest Validation
    The resolved manifest(s) and prototype install tree are passed through
    a set of validations.  This includes running pkglint(1), comparing the
    manifest content to the prototype install tree, and validation of the file
    content of the prototype install tree.  Any anomalies are reported.
    Content validation is performed by extension to pkglint(1) in
    $(WS_TOP)/tools/python/userland-lint

Publication.
    Once manifest validation has occurred, the package(s) is/are finally
    published to the workspace package repository.
